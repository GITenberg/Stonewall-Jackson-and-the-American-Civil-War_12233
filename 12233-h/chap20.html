<p class="one"><span class="date">1862. October  </span> While
the Army of Northern Virginia was resting in the Valley,
McClellan was preparing for a winter campaign. He was unable,
however, to keep pace with the impatience of the Northern people.
Not only was he determined to postpone all movement until his
army was properly equipped, his ranks recruited, his cavalry
remounted, and his administrative services reorganised, but the
military authorities at Washington were very slow in meeting his
demands. Notwithstanding, then, the orders of the President, the
remonstrances of Halleck, and the clamour of the press, for more
than five weeks after the battle of Sharpsburg he remained
inactive on the Potomac. It may be that in the interests of the
army he was perfectly right in resisting the pressure brought to
bear upon him. He was certainly the best judge of the temper of
his troops, and could estimate more exactly than either Lincoln
or Halleck the chances of success if he were to encounter
Lee&rsquo;s veterans on their native soil. However this may be,
his inaction was not in accordance with the demands of the
political situation. The President, immediately the Confederates
retired from Maryland, had taken a step which changed the
character of the war. Hitherto the Northerners had fought for the
restoration of the Union on the basis of the Constitution, as
interpreted by themselves. Now, after eighteen months of
conflict, the Constitution was deliberately violated. For the
clause which forbade all interference with the domestic
institutions of the several States, a declaration that slavery
should no longer exist within the boundaries</p>
<p class="folio">STUART&rsquo;S RIDE  <a name="page 290"><font
size="+1">290</font></a></p>
<p class="one">of the Republic was substituted, and the armies of
the Union were called upon to fight for the freedom of the
negro.</p>
<p>In the condition of political parties this measure was daring.
It was not approved by the Democrats, and many of the soldiers
were Democrats; or by those&mdash;and they were not a
few&mdash;who believed that compromise was the surest means of
restoring peace; or by those&mdash;and they were
numerous&mdash;who thought the dissolution of the Union a smaller
evil than the continuance of the war. The opposition was very
strong, and there was but one means of reconciling
it&mdash;vigorous action on the part of the army, the immediate
invasion of Virginia, and a decisive victory. Delay would expose
the framers of the measure to the imputation of having promised
more than they could perform, of wantonly tampering with the
Constitution, and of widening the breach between North and South
beyond all hope of healing.</p>
<p>In consequence, therefore, of McClellan&rsquo;s refusal to
move forward, the friction between the Federal Government and
their general-in-chief, which, so long as Lee remained in
Maryland, had been allayed, once more asserted its baneful
influence; and the aggressive attitude of the Confederates did
not serve to make matters smoother. Although the greater part of
October was for the Army of Northern Virginia a period of unusual
leisure, the troops were not altogether idle. As soon as the
stragglers had been brought in, and the ranks of the divisions
once more presented a respectable appearance, various enterprises
were undertaken. The Second Army Corps was entrusted with the
destruction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, a duty carried out
by Jackson with characteristic thoroughness. The line from
Harper&rsquo;s Ferry to Winchester, as well as that from Manassas
Junction to Strasburg, were also torn up; and the spoils of the
late campaign were sent south to Richmond and Staunton. These
preparations for defensive warfare were not, however, so
immediately embarrassing to the enemy as the action of the
cavalry. Stuart&rsquo;s three brigades, after the affair at</p>
<p class="folio">STUART&rsquo;S RIDE  <a name="page 291"><font
size="+1">291</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Boteler&rsquo;s Ford, picketed the line of the
Potomac from the North Mountain to the Shenandoah, a distance of
forty miles: Hampton&rsquo;s brigade at Hedgesville, Fitzhugh
Lee&rsquo;s at Shepherdstown, Munford&rsquo;s at Charlestown, and
headquarters near Leetown.</p>
<p>On October 8 General Lee, suspecting that McClellan was
meditating some movement, ordered the cavalry to cross the
Potomac and reconnoitre.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 9  </span> Selecting 600 men from each
of his brigades, with General Hampton, Colonels W. H. F. Lee and
W. E. Jones in command, and accompanied by four horse-artillery
guns, Stuart rendezvoused on the night of the 9th at Darkesville.
As the day dawned he crossed the Potomac at McCoy&rsquo;s Ford,
drove in the Federal pickets, and broke up a signal station near
Fairview.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 10  </span> Marching due north, he
reached Mercersburg at noon, and Chambersburg, forty-six miles
from Darkesville, at 7 p.m. on October 10. Chambersburg, although
a Federal supply dep&ocirc;t of some importance, was without a
garrison, and here 275 sick and wounded were paroled, 500 horses
requisitioned, the wires cut, and the railroad obstructed; while
the machine shops, several trains of loaded cars, and a large
quantity of small arms, ammunition, and clothing was
destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 11  </span> At nine the next morning
the force marched in the direction of Gettysburg, moving round
the Federal rear. Then, crossing the mountains, it turned south
through Emmittsburg, passed the Monocacy near Frederick, and
after a march of ninety miles since leaving Chambersburg reached
Hyattstown at daylight on the 12th.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct.12  </span> Here, on the road which
formed McClellan&rsquo;s line of communication with Washington, a
few waggons were captured, and information came to hand that
4,000 or 5,000 Federal troops were near Poolesville, guarding the
fords across the Potomac. Moving at a trot through the woods, the
column, leaving Poolesville two or three miles to the left, made
for the mouth of the Monocacy. About a mile and a half from that
river an advanced guard of hostile cavalry, moving eastward, was
encountered and driven in. Colonel Lee&rsquo;s men were</p>
<p class="folio">STUART&rsquo;S RIDE  <a name="page 292"><font
size="+1">292</font></a></p>
<p class="one">dismounted, a gun was brought into action, and
under cover of this screen, posted on a high crest, the main body
made a dash for White&rsquo;s Ford. The point of passage,
although guarded by about 100 Federal riflemen, was quickly
seized, and Stuart&rsquo;s whole force, together with the
captured horses, had completed the crossing before the enemy,
advancing in large force from the Monocacy, was in a position to
interfere.</p>
<p>This brilliantly conducted expedition was as fruitful of
results as the ride round McClellan&rsquo;s army in the previous
June. The information obtained was most important. Lee, besides
being furnished with a sufficiently full report of the Federal
dispositions, learned that no part of McClellan&rsquo;s army had
been detached to Washington, but that it was being reinforced
from that quarter, and that therefore no over-sea expedition
against Richmond was to be apprehended. Several hundred fine
horses from the farms of Pennsylvania furnished excellent
remounts for the Confederate troopers. Prominent officials were
brought in as hostages for the safety of the Virginia citizens
who had been thrown into Northern prisons. Only a few scouts were
captured by the enemy, and not a man was killed. The distance
marched by Stuart, from Darkesville to White&rsquo;s Ford, was
one hundred and twenty-six miles, of which the last eighty were
covered without a halt. Crossing the Potomac at McCoy&rsquo;s
Ford about 6 a.m. on October 10, he had recrossed it at
White&rsquo;s Ford, between 1 and 2 p.m. on October 12; he was
thus for fifty-six hours inside the enemy&rsquo;s lines, and
during the greater part of his march within thirty miles of
McClellan&rsquo;s headquarters near Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>
<p>It is often the case in war that a well-planned and boldly
executed enterprise has a far greater effect than could possibly
have been anticipated. Neither Lee nor Stuart looked for larger
results from this raid than a certain amount of plunder and a
good deal of intelligence. But skill and daring were crowned with
a more ample reward than the attainment of the immediate
object.</p>
<p>In the first place, the expedition, although there was little
fighting, was most destructive to the Federal cavalry.</p>
<p class="folio">STUART&rsquo;S RIDE  <a name="page 293"><font
size="+1">293</font></a></p>
<p class="one">McClellan had done all in his power to arrest the
raiders. Directly the news came in that they had crossed the
Potomac, troops were sent in every direction to cut off their
retreat. Yet so eminently judicious were Stuart&rsquo;s
precautions, so intelligent the Maryland soldiers who acted as
his guides, and so rapid his movements, that although constant
reports were received by the Federal generals as to the progress
and direction of his column, the information came always too late
to serve any practical purpose, and his pursuers were never in
time to bar his march. General Pleasanton, with such cavalry as
could be spared from the picket line, marched seventy-eight miles
in four-and-twenty hours, and General Averell&rsquo;s brigade,
quartered on the Upper Potomac, two hundred miles in four days.
The severity of the marches told heavily on these commands,
already worn out by hard work on the outposts; and so many of the
horses broke down that a period of repose was absolutely
necessary to refit them for the field. Until his cavalry should
have recovered it was impossible for McClellan to invade
Virginia.</p>
<p>In the second place, neither the Northern Government nor the
Northern people could forget that this was the second time that
McClellan had allowed Stuart to ride at will round the Army of
the Potomac. Public confidence in the general-in-chief was
greatly shaken; and a handle was given to his opponents in the
ranks of the abolitionists, who, because he was a Democrat, and
had much influence with the army, were already clamouring for his
removal.</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 26  </span> The respite which Stuart
had gained for Virginia was not, however, of long duration. On
October 26, McClellan, having ascertained by means of a strong
reconnaissance in force that the Confederate army was still in
the vicinity of Winchester, commenced the passage of the Potomac.
The principal point of crossing was near Berlin, and so soon as
it became evident that the Federal line of operations lay east of
the Blue Ridge, Lee ordered Longstreet to Culpeper Court House.
Jackson, taking post on the road between Berryville and
Charlestown, was to remain in the Valley.</p>

<br>
<p>The Confederates were not only heavily outnumbered by the
force immediately before them, but along the Potomac, from
Washington westward, was a second hostile army, not indeed so
large as that commanded by</p>
<p class="folio">LINCOLN&rsquo;S STRATEGY  <a name=
"page 295"><font size="+1">295</font></a></p>
<p class="one">McClellan, but larger by several thousands than
that commanded by Lee. The Northern capital held a garrison of
80,000; at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry were 10,000; in the neighbourhood
of Sharpsburg over 4,000; along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
8,000. Thus the total strength of the Federals exceeded 225,000
men. Yet in face of this enormous host, and with Richmond only
weakly garrisoned behind him, Lee had actually separated his two
wings by an interval of sixty miles. He was evidently playing his
old game, dividing his army with a view to a junction on the
field of battle.</p>
<p>Lincoln, in a letter of advice with which he had favoured
McClellan a few days previously, had urged the importance of
making Lee&rsquo;s line of supply the first objective of the
invading army. &ldquo;An advance east of the Blue Ridge,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;would at once menace the enemy&rsquo;s line of
communications, and compel him to keep his forces together; and
if Lee, disregarding this menace, were to cut in between the Army
of the Potomac and Washington, McClellan would have nothing to do
but to attack him in rear.&rdquo; He suggested, moreover, that by
hard marching it might be possible for McClellan to reach
Richmond first.</p>
<p>The Confederate line of communications, so the President
believed, ran from Richmond to Culpeper Court House, and
McClellan&rsquo;s advanced guards, on November 7, were within
twenty miles of that point. Lee, however, had altogether failed
to respond to Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s strategical pronouncements.
Instead of concentrating his forces he had dispersed them; and
instead of fearing for his own communications, he had placed
Jackson in a position to interfere very seriously with those of
his enemy.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s letter to McClellan shows that the lessons
of the war had not been altogether lost upon him. Generals Banks
and Pope, with some stimulus from Stonewall Jackson, had taught
him what an important part is played by lines of supply. He had
mastered the strategical truism that an enemy&rsquo;s
communications are his weakest point. But there were other
considerations which had not come home to him. He had overlooked
the possibility</p>
<p class="folio">LINCOLN&rsquo;S STRATEGY  <a name=
"page 296"><font size="+1">296</font></a></p>
<p class="one">that Lee might threaten McClellan&rsquo;s
communications before McClellan could threaten his; and he had
yet to learn that an army operating in its own country, if proper
forethought be exercised, can establish an alternative line of
supply, and provide itself with a double base, thus gaining a
freedom of action of which an invader, bound, unless he has
command of the sea, to a single line, is generally deprived.</p>
<p>The President appears to have thought that, if Lee were cut
off from Richmond, the Army of Northern Virginia would be reduced
to starvation, and become absolutely powerless. It never entered
his head that the astute commander of that army had already, in
anticipation of the very movement which McClellan was now making,
established a second base at Staunton, and that his line of
supply, in case of necessity, would not run over the open country
between Richmond and Gordonsville, but from Staunton to Culpeper,
behind the ramparts of the Blue Ridge.</p>
<p>Lee, in fact, accepted with equanimity the possibility of the
Federals intervening between himself and Richmond. He had
already, in the campaign against Pope, extricated himself from
such a situation by a bold stroke against his enemy&rsquo;s
communications; and the natural fastness of the Valley, amply
provided with food and forage, afforded facilities for such a
man&oelig;uvre which had been altogether absent before the Second
Manassas. Nor was he of Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s opinion, that if the
Army of Northern Virginia cut in between Washington and McClellan
it would be a simple operation for the latter to about face and
attack the Confederates in rear. He knew, and Mr. Lincoln, if he
had studied Pope&rsquo;s campaign, should have known it too, that
the operation of countermarching, if the line of communication
has been cut, is not only apt to produce great confusion and
great suffering, but has the very worst effect on the
<i>moral</i> of the troops. But Lee had that practical experience
which Mr. Lincoln lacked, and without which it is but waste of
words to dogmatise on strategy. He was well aware that a large
army is a cumbrous machine, not readily deflected from the
original</p>
<p class="folio">CONCENTRATION DEFERRED  <a name="page 297"><font
size="+1">297</font></a></p>
<p class="one">direction of the line of march;<sup>1</sup> and,
more than all, he had that intimate acquaintance with the soldier
in the ranks, that knowledge of the human factor, without which
no military problem, whether of strategy, tactics, or
organisation, can be satisfactorily solved. McClellan&rsquo;s
task, therefore, so long as he had to depend for his supplies on
a single line of railway, was not quite so simple as Mr. Lincoln
imagined.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on November 7 Lee decided to unite his army. As
soon as the enemy advanced from Warrenton, Jackson was to ascend
the Valley, and crossing the Blue Ridge at Fisher&rsquo;s Gap,
join hands with Longstreet, who would retire from Madison Court
House to the vicinity of Gordonsville. The Confederates would
then be concentrated on McClellan&rsquo;s right flank should he
march on Richmond, ready to take advantage of any opportunity for
attack; or, if attack were considered too hazardous, to threaten
his communications, and compel him to fall back to the
Potomac.</p>
<p>The proposed concentration, however, was not immediately
carried out. In the first place, the Federal advance came to a
sudden standstill; and, in the second place, Jackson was
unwilling to abandon his post of vantage behind the Blue Ridge.
It need hardly be said that the policy of man&oelig;uvring
instead of intrenching, of aiming at the enemy&rsquo;s flank and
rear instead of barring his advance directly, was in full
agreement with his views of war; and it appears that about this
date he had submitted proposals for a movement against the
Federal communications. It would be interesting indeed to have
the details of his design, but Jackson&rsquo;s letter-book for
this period has unfortunately disappeared, nor did he communicate
his ideas to any of his staff. Letters from General Lee, however,
indicate that the man&oelig;uvre proposed was of the same
character as</p>
<p class="fnote">1  On November 1 the Army of the Potomac (not
including the Third Corps) was accompanied by 4,818 waggons and
ambulances, 8,500 transport horses, and 12,000 mules. O.R., vol.
xix, part i, pp. 97&ndash;8. The train of each army corps and of
the cavalry covered eight miles of road, or fifty miles for the
whole.</p>
<p class="folio">CONCENTRATION DEFERRED  <a name="page 298"><font
size="+1">298</font></a></p>
<p class="one">that which brought Pope in such hot haste from the
Rappahannock to Bull Run, and that it was Jackson&rsquo;s
suggestion which caused the Commander-in-Chief to reconsider his
determination of uniting his army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as General Jackson,&rdquo; wrote Lee to the
Secretary of War on November 10, &ldquo;can operate with safety,
and secure his retirement west of the Massanutton Mountains, I
think it advantageous that he should be in a position to threaten
the enemy&rsquo;s flank and rear, and thus prevent his advance
southward on the east side of the Blue Ridge. General Jackson has
been directed accordingly, and should the enemy descend into the
Valley, General Longstreet will attack his rear, and cut off his
communications. The enemy apparently is so strong in numbers that
I think it preferable to baffle his designs by man&oelig;uvring,
rather than resist his advance by main force, To accomplish the
latter without too great a risk and loss would require more than
double our present numbers.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>His letter to Jackson, dated November 9, ran as follows:
&ldquo;The enemy seems to be massing his troops along the
Manassas Railroad in the vicinity of Piedmont, which gives him
great facilities for bringing up supplies from Alexandria. It has
occurred to me that his object may be to seize upon Strasburg
with his main force, to intercept your ascent of the Valley. . .
. This would oblige you to cross into the Lost River Valley, or
west of it, unless you could force a passage through the Blue
Ridge; hence my anxiety for your safety. If you can prevent such
a movement of the enemy, and operate strongly on his flank and
rear through the gaps of the Blue Ridge, you would certainly in
my opinion effect the object you propose. A demonstration of
crossing into Maryland would serve the same purpose, and might
call him back to the Potomac. As my object is to retard and
baffle his designs, if it can be accomplished by man&oelig;uvring
your corps as you propose, it will serve my purpose as well as if
effected in any other way. With this understanding, you can use
your discretion, which I know I can rely upon, in remaining or
advancing up the</p>
<p class="fnote">1  O.R., vol. xix, part ii, p. 711.</p>
<p class="folio">McCLELLAN SUPERSEDED  <a name="page 299"><font
size="+1">299</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Valley. Keep me advised of your movements and
intentions; and you must keep always in view the probability of
an attack upon Richmond from either north or south, when a
concentration of force will become
necessary.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s plan, however, was not destined to be tried.
McClellan had issued orders for the concentration of his army at
Warrenton. His troops had never been in better condition. They
were in good spirits, well supplied and admirably equipped. Owing
to the activity of his cavalry, coupled with the fact that the
Confederate horses were at this time attacked by a disease which
affected both tongue and hoof, his information was more accurate
than usual. He knew that Longstreet was at Culpeper, and Jackson
in the Valley. He saw the possibility of separating the two wings
of the enemy&rsquo;s forces, and of either defeating Longstreet
or forcing him to fall back to Gordonsville, and he had
determined to make the attempt.</p>
<p>On the night of November 7, however, at the very moment when
his army was concentrating for an advance against Longstreet,
McClellan was ordered to hand over his command to General
Burnside. Lincoln had yielded to the insistence of
McClellan&rsquo;s political opponents, to the rancour of Stanton,
and the jealousy of Halleck. But in sacrificing the general who
had saved the Union at Sharpsburg he sacrificed the lives of many
thousands of his soldiers. A darker day than even the Second
Manassas was in store for the Army of the Potomac. McClellan was
not a general of the first order. But he was the only officer in
the United States who had experience of handling large masses of
troops, and he was improving every day. Stuart had taught him the
use of cavalry, and Lee the value of the initiative. He was by no
means deficient in resolution, as his march with an army of
recently defeated men against Lee in Maryland conclusively
proves; and although he had never won a decisive victory, he
possessed, to a degree which was never attained by any of his
successors, the confidence and affection of his troops. But
deplorable</p>
<p class="fnote">1  O.R., vol. xix, part ii, p. 705.</p>
<p class="folio">McCLELLAN SUPERSEDED  <a name="page 300"><font
size="+1">300</font></a></p>
<p class="one">as was the weakness which sanctioned his removal
on the eve of a decisive man&oelig;uvre, the blunder which put
Burnside in his place was even more so. The latter appears to
have been the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of a small political
faction. He had many good qualities. He was a firm friend,
modest, generous, and energetic. But he was so far from being
distinguished for military ability that in the Army of the
Potomac it was very strongly questioned whether he was fit to
command an army corps. His conduct at Sharpsburg, where he had
been entrusted with the attack on the Confederate right, had been
the subject of the severest criticism, and by not a few of his
colleagues he was considered directly responsible for the want of
combination which had marred McClellan&rsquo;s plan of attack.
More than once Mr. Lincoln infringed his own famous aphorism,
&ldquo;Never swap horses when crossing a stream,&rdquo; but when
he transferred the destinies of the Army of the Potomac from
McClellan to Burnside he did more&mdash;he selected the weakest
of his team of generals to bear the burden.</p>
<p>At the same time that McClellan was superseded, General
FitzJohn Porter, the gallant soldier of Gaines&rsquo; Mill and
Malvern Hill, probably the best officer in the Army of the
Potomac, was ordered to resign command of the Fifth Army Corps,
and to appear before a court-martial on charges of incompetency
and neglect of duty at the Second Manassas. The fact that those
charges were preferred by Pope, and that Porter had been allowed
to retain his command through the campaign in Maryland, were
hardly calculated to inspire the army with confidence in either
the wisdom or the justice of its rulers; and it was the general
opinion that his intimate friendship with McClellan had more to
say to his trial than his alleged incompetency.</p>
<p>Burnside commenced his career by renouncing the enterprise
which McClellan had contemplated. Longstreet was left unmolested
at Culpeper; and, in order to free the communications from
Jackson, the Federal army was marched eastward along the
Rappahannock to Falmouth, a new line of supply being established
between that village</p>
<p class="folio">RAPID MARCH OF THE FEDERALS  <a name=
"page 301"><font size="+1">301</font></a></p>
<p class="one">and Aquia Creek, the port on the Potomac, six
hours&rsquo; sail from Washington.</p>
<p>Lee had already foreseen that Jackson&rsquo;s presence in the
Valley might induce the Federals to change their line of
operations. Fredericksburg, on the south side of the
Rappahannock, and the terminus of the Richmond and Potomac
Railroad, had consequently been garrisoned by an infantry
regiment and a battery, while three regiments of cavalry
patrolled the river. This force, however, was not posted on the
Rappahannock with a view of retarding the enemy&rsquo;s advance,
but merely for observation. Lee, at this date, had no intention
of concentrating at Fredericksburg. The Federals, if they acted
with resolution, could readily forestall him, and the line of the
North Anna, a small but difficult stream, thirty-six miles south,
offered peculiar advantages to the defence.</p>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 17  </span> The Federal march was
rapid. On November 15 the Army of the Potomac left Warrenton, and
the advanced guard reached Falmouth on the afternoon of the 17th.
General Sumner, in command, observing the weakness of the
Confederate garrison, requested permission from Burnside to cross
the Rappahannock and establish himself on the further bank.
Although two army corps were at hand, and the remainder were
rapidly closing up, Burnside refused, for the bridges had been
broken, and he was unwilling to expose part of his forces on the
right bank with no means of retreat except a difficult and
uncertain ford. The same day, part of Longstreet&rsquo;s corps
and a brigade of cavalry were sent to Fredericksburg; and on the
19th, Lee, finding that the Federals had left Warrenton, ordered
Longstreet to concentrate his whole force at Fredericksburg, and
summoned Jackson from the Valley to Orange Court House.</p>
<p>Jackson, meanwhile, had moved to Winchester, probably with the
design of threatening the enemy&rsquo;s garrisons on the Potomac,
and this unexpected movement had caused much perturbation in the
North. Pennsylvania and Maryland expected nothing less than
instant invasion. The merchant feared for his strong-box, the
farmer for</p>

<p class="one">his herds; plate was once more packed up; railway
presidents demanded further protection for their lines; generals
begged for reinforcements, and, according to the
&ldquo;Times&rdquo; Correspondent, it was &ldquo;the universal
belief that Stonewall Jackson was ready to pounce upon Washington
from the Shenandoah, and to capture President, Secretaries, and
all.&rdquo; But before apprehension increased to panic, before
Mr. Lincoln had become infected by the prevailing uneasiness, the
departure of the Confederates from the Valley brought relief to
the affrighted citizens.</p>
<p>On November 22 Jackson bade farewell to Winchester. His
headquarters were not more than a hundred yards from Dr.
Graham&rsquo;s manse, and he spent his last evening with his old
friends. &ldquo;He was in fine health and fine spirits,&rdquo;
wrote the minister&rsquo;s wife to Mrs. Jackson. &ldquo;The
children begged to be permitted to sit up to see &ldquo;General
Jackson,&rdquo; and he really seemed overjoyed to see them,
played with them and fondled them, and they were equally pleased.
I have no doubt it was a great recreation to him. He seemed to be
living over last winter again, and talked a great deal about the
hope of getting back to spend this winter with us, in the old
room, which I told him I was keeping for you and him. He
certainly has had adulation enough to spoil him, but it seems not
to affect or harm him at all. He is the same humble, dependent
Christian, desiring to give God all the glory, looking to Him
alone for a blessing, and not thinking of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was with no presage that this was the last time he would
look upon the scenes he loved that Jackson moved southward by the
Valley turnpike. Past Kernstown his columns swept, past
Middletown and Strasburg, and all the well-remembered fields of
former triumphs; until the peaks of the Massanuttons threw their
shadows across the highway, and the mighty bulk of the noble
mountains, draped in the gold and crimson of the autumn, once
more re-echoed to the tramp of his swift-footed veterans. Turning
east at New Market, he struck upwards by the familiar road; and
then, descending the narrow pass, he forded the</p>
<p class="folio">THE CONFEDERATE DISPOSITIONS  <a name=
"page 303"><font size="+1">303</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Shenandoah, and crossing the Luray valley vanished
in the forests of the Blue Ridge. Through the dark pines of
Fisher&rsquo;s Gap he led his soldiers down to the Virginia
plains, and the rivers and the mountains knew him no more until
their dead returned to them.</p>
<p>On the 26th the Second Army Corps was at Madison Court
House.</p>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 27  </span> The next day it was
concentrated at Orange Court House, six-and-thirty miles from
Fredericksburg. In eight days, two being given to rest, the
troops had marched one hundred and twenty miles, and with scarce
a straggler, for the stern measures which had been taken to put
discipline on a firmer basis, and to make the regimental officers
do their duty, had already produced a salutary effect.</p>
<p>On Jackson&rsquo;s arrival at Orange Court House he found the
situation unchanged. Burnside, notwithstanding that heavy
snow-storms and sharp frosts betokened the approach of winter,
the season of impassable roads and swollen rivers, was still
encamped near Falmouth. The difficulty of establishing a new base
of supplies at Aquia Creek, and some delay on the part of the
Washington authorities in furnishing him with a pontoon train,
had kept him idle; but he had not relinquished his design of
marching upon Richmond. His quiescence, however, together with
the wishes of the President, had induced General Lee to change
his plans. The Army of Northern Virginia, 78,500 strong,
although, in order to induce the Federals to attack, it was not
yet closely concentrated, was ready to oppose in full force the
passage of the Rappahannock, and all thought of retiring to the
North Anna had been abandoned.</p>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 29  </span> On November 29, therefore,
Jackson was ordered forward, and while the First Army Corps
occupied a strong position in rear of Fredericksburg, with an
advanced detachment in the town, the Second was told off to
protect the lower reaches of the Rappahannock. Ewell&rsquo;s
division, still commanded by Early, was posted at Skinker&rsquo;s
Neck, twelve miles south-east of Fredericksburg, a spot which
afforded many facilities for crossing; D. H. Hill&rsquo;s at Port
Royal, already menaced by Federal gunboats, six</p>
<p class="folio">THE CONFEDERATE DISPOSITIONS  <a name=
"page 304"><font size="+1">304</font></a></p>
<p class="one">miles further down stream; A. P. Hill&rsquo;s and
Taliaferro&rsquo;s (Jackson&rsquo;s own) at Yerby&rsquo;s House
and Guiney&rsquo;s Station, five and nine miles respectively from
Longstreet&rsquo;s right; and Stuart, whose division was now
increased to four brigades, watched both front and flanks.</p>
<p>The Rappahannock was undoubtedly a formidable obstacle.
Navigable for small vessels as far as Fredericksburg, the head of
the tide water, it is two hundred yards wide in the neighbourhood
of the city, and it increases in width and depth as it flows
seaward. But above Falmouth there are several easy fords; the
river banks, except near Fredericksburg, are clad with forest,
hiding the movements of troops; and from Falmouth downward, the
left bank, under the name of the Stafford Heights, so completely
commands the right that it was manifestly impossible for the
Confederates to prevent the enemy, furnished with a far superior
artillery, from making good the passage of the stream. A mile
west of Fredericksburg, however, extending from Beck&rsquo;s
Island to the heights beyond the Massaponax Creek, runs a long
low ridge, broken by ravines and partially covered with timber,
which with some slight aid from axe and spade could be rendered
an exceedingly strong position. Longstreet, who occupied this
ridge, had been ordered to intrench himself; gun-pits had been
dug on the bare crest, named Marye&rsquo;s Hill, which
immediately faces Fredericksburg; a few shelter-trenches had been
thrown up, natural defences improved, and some slight breastworks
and abattis constructed along the outskirts of the woods. These
works were at extreme range from the Stafford Heights; and the
field of fire, extending as far as the river, a distance varying
from fifteen hundred to three thousand yards, needed no clearing.
Over such ground a frontal attack, even if made by superior
numbers, had little chance of success.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding its manifest advantages the position found
no favour in the eyes of Jackson. It could be easily turned by
the fords above Falmouth&mdash;Banks&rsquo;, United States,
Ely&rsquo;s, and Germanna. This, however, was a minor
disqualification compared with the restrictions in</p>
<p class="folio">JACKSON&rsquo;S ADVICE OVERRULED  <a name=
"page 305"><font size="+1">305</font></a></p>
<p class="one">the way of offensive action. If the enemy should
cross at Fredericksburg, both his flanks would be protected by
the river, while his numerous batteries, arrayed on the Stafford
Heights, and commanding the length and the breadth of the
battle-field, would make counterstroke difficult and pursuit
impossible. To await attack, moreover, was to allow the enemy to
choose his own time and place, and to surrender the advantages of
the initiative. Burnside&rsquo;s communications were protected by
the Rappahannock, and it was thus impracticable to man&oelig;uvre
against his most vulnerable point, to inflict on him a surprise,
to compel him to change front, and, in case he were defeated, to
cut him off from his base and deprive him of his supplies. The
line of the North Anna, in Jackson&rsquo;s opinion, promised far
greater results. The Federals, advancing from Fredericksburg,
would expose their right flank and their communications for a
distance of six-and-thirty miles; and if they were compelled to
retreat, the destruction of their whole army was within the
bounds of possibility. &ldquo;I am opposed,&rdquo; he said to
General D. H. Hill, &ldquo;to fighting on the Rappahannock. We
will whip the enemy, but gain no fruits of victory. I have
advised the line of the North Anna, but have been
overruled.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>So the days passed on. The country was white with snow. The
temperature was near zero, and the troops, their blankets as
threadbare as their uniforms, without greatcoats, and in many
instances without boots, shivered beneath the rude shelters of
their forest bivouacs. Fortunately there was plenty of work.
Roads were cut through the woods, and existing tracks improved.
The river banks were incessantly patrolled. Fortifications were
constructed at Port Royal and Skinker&rsquo;s Neck, and the
movements of the Federals, demonstrating now here and now there,
kept the whole army on the alert. Nor were Jackson&rsquo;s men
deprived of all excitement. He had the satisfaction of reporting
to General Lee that D. H. Hill, with the aid of Stuart&rsquo;s
horse-artillery, had frustrated two attempts of the Federal
gunboats to pass up the river at Port Royal;</p>

<p class="folio">JACKSON&rsquo;S ADVICE OVERRULED  <a name=
"page 306"><font size="+1">306</font></a></p>
<p class="one">and that the vigilance of Early at Skinker&rsquo;s
Neck had caused the enemy to abandon the design which he had
apparently conceived of crossing at that point.</p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 11  </span> But more vigorous
operations were not long postponed. On December 10, General
Burnside, urged by the impatience of the Northern press,
determined to advance, and the next morning, at 3 a.m., the
signal guns of the Confederates gave notice that the enemy was in
motion. One hundred and forty Federal guns, many of large
calibre, placed in epaulments on the Stafford Heights, frowned
down upon Fredericksburg, and before the sun rose the Federal
bridge builders were at work on the opposite shore. The little
city, which had been deserted by the inhabitants, was held by
Barksdale&rsquo;s Mississippi brigade of McLaws&rsquo; division,
about 1,600 strong, and the conduct of this advanced detachment
must have done much to inspirit the troops who watched their
prowess from the ridge in rear. A heavy fog hung upon the water,
and not until the bridge was two-thirds completed, and shadowy
figures became visible in the mist, did the Mississippians open
fire. At such close quarters the effect was immediate, and the
builders fled. Twice, at intervals of half an hour, they ventured
again upon the deserted bridge, and twice were they driven back.
Strong detachments were now moved forward by the Federals to
cover the working parties, and artillery began to play upon the
town. The Southerners, however, securely posted in rifle-pits and
cellars, were not to be dislodged; and at ten o&rsquo;clock
Burnside ordered the heavy batteries into action. Every gun which
could be brought to bear on Fredericksburg discharged fifty
rounds of shot and shell. To this bombardment, which lasted
upwards of an hour, Longstreet&rsquo;s artillery could make no
reply. Yet though the effect on the buildings was appalling, and
flames broke out in many places, the defenders not only suffered
little loss, but at the very height of the cannonade repelled
another attempt to complete the bridge.</p>
<p>After a delay of several hours General Hooker, commanding the
advance, called for volunteers to cross the river in boats. Four
regiments came forward. The pontoons</p>
<p class="folio">THE FEDERALS CROSS THE RIVER  <a name=
"page 307"><font size="+1">307</font></a></p>
<p class="one">were manned, and though many lives were lost
during the transit, the gallant Federals pushed quickly across;
others followed, and Barksdale, who had no orders to hold the
place against superior strength, withdrew his men from the river
bank. About 4.30 p.m., three bridges being at last established,
the enemy pushed forward, and the Mississippians, retiring in
good order, evacuated Fredericksburg. A mile below, near the
mouth of Hazel Run, the Confederate outposts had been driven in,
and three more bridges had been thrown across. Thus on the night
of the 11th the Federals, who were now organised in three Grand
Divisions, each of two army corps, had established their advanced
guards on the right bank of the Rappahannock, and, under cover of
the batteries on the Stafford Heights, could rapidly and safely
pass over their great host of 120,000 men.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Burnside had framed his plan of attack on the assumption that
Lee&rsquo;s army was dispersed along the Rappahannock. His
balloon had reported large Confederate bivouacs below
Skinker&rsquo;s Neck, and he appears to have believed that Lee,
alarmed by his demonstrations near Port Royal, had posted half
his army in that neighbourhood. Utterly unsuspicious that a trap
had been laid for him, he had resolved to take advantage of this
apparently vicious distribution, and, crossing rapidly at
Fredericksburg, to defeat the Confederate left before the right
could lend support. Port Royal is but eighteen miles from
Fredericksburg, and in prompt action, therefore, lay his only
hope of success. Burnside, however, after the successful
establishment, of his six bridges, evinced the same want of
resolution which had won him so unenviable a reputation at
Sharpsburg. The long hours of darkness slipped peacefully away;
no unusual sound broke the silence of the night, and all was
still along the Rappahannock.</p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 12  </span> It was not till the next
morning, December 12, that the army began to cross, and the
movement, made difficult by a dense fog, was by no means
energetic. Four of the six army corps were transferred during
the</p>

<p class="one">day to the southern bank; but beyond a cavalry
reconnaissance, which was checked by Stuart, there was no
fighting, and to every man in the Federal ranks it was perfectly
plain that the delay was fatal.</p>
<p>Lee, meanwhile, with ample time at his disposal and full
confidence in the wisdom of his dispositions, calmly awaited the
development of his adversary&rsquo;s plans. Jackson brought up A.
P. Hill and Taliaferro at noon, and posted them on
Longstreet&rsquo;s right; but it was not till that hour, when it
had at last become certain that the whole Federal army was
crossing, that couriers were dispatched to call in Early and D.
H. Hill. Once more the Army of Northern Virginia was concentrated
at exactly the right moment on the field of
battle.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 13  </span> Like its predecessor,
December 13 broke dull and calm, and the mist which shrouded
river and plain hid from each other the rival hosts. Long before
daybreak the Federal divisions still beyond the stream began to
cross; and as the morning wore on, and the troops near Hazel Run
moved forward from their bivouacs, the rumbling of artillery on
the frozen roads, the loud words of command, and the sound of
martial music came, muffled by the fog, to the ears of the
Confederates lying expectant on the ridge. Now and again the
curtain lifted for a moment, and the Southern guns assailed the
long dark columns of the foe. Very early had the Confederates
taken up their position. The ravine of Deep Run, covered with
tangled brushwood, was the line of demarcation between Jackson
and Longstreet. On the extreme right of the Second Corps, and
half a mile north of the marshy valley of the Massaponax, where a
spur called Prospect Hill juts down from the wooded ridge, were
fourteen guns under Colonel Walker. Supported by two regiments of
Field&rsquo;s brigade, these pieces were held back for the
present within the forest which here clothed the ridge. Below
Prospect Hill, and running thence along the front of the
position, the embankment of the Richmond and Potomac Railroad
formed a tempting breastwork. It was utilised, however,</p>
<p class="fnote">1  Lord Wolseley. <i>North American Review,</i>
vol. 149, p. 282.</p>
<p class="folio">THE CONFEDERATE POSITION  <a name=

<p class="one">only by the skirmishers of the defence. The edge
of the forest, One hundred and fifty to two hundred yards in
rear, looked down upon an open and gentle slope, and along the
brow of this natural glacis, covered by the thick timber, Jackson
posted his fighting-line. To this position it was easy to move up
his supports and reserves without exposing them to the fire of
artillery; and if the assailants should seize the embankment, he
relied upon the deadly rifles of his infantry to bar their
further advance up the ascent beyond.</p>
<p>The Light Division supplied both the first and second lines of
Jackson&rsquo;s army corps. To the left of Walker&rsquo;s guns,
posted in a shelter-trench within the skirts of the wood, was
Archer&rsquo;s brigade of seven regiments, including two of
Field&rsquo;s, the left resting on a coppice that projected
beyond the general line of forest. On the further side of this
coppice, but nearer the embankment, lay Lane&rsquo;s brigade, an
unoccupied space of six hundred yards intervening between his
right and Archer&rsquo;s left. Between Lane&rsquo;s right and the
edge of the coppice was an open tract two hundred yards in
breadth. Both of these brigades had a strong skirmish line pushed
forward along and beyond the railroad. Five hundred yards in
rear, along a road through the woods which had been cut by
Longstreet&rsquo;s troops, Gregg&rsquo;s South Carolina brigade,
in second line, covered the interval between Archer and Lane. To
Lane&rsquo;s left rear lay Pender&rsquo;s brigade, supporting
twelve guns posted in the open, on the far side of the
embankment, and twenty-one massed in a field to the north of a
small house named Bernard&rsquo;s Cabin. Four hundred yards in
rear of Lane&rsquo;s left and Pender&rsquo;s right was stationed
Thomas&rsquo;s brigade of four regiments.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>It is necessary to notice particularly the shape, size, and
position of the projecting tongue of woodland which</p>

<p class="one">broke the continuity of Hill&rsquo;s line. A
German officer on Stuart&rsquo;s staff had the day previous,
while riding along the position, remarked its existence, and
suggested the propriety of razing it; but, although Jackson
himself predicted that there would be the scene of the severest
fighting, the ground was so marshy within its depths, and the
undergrowth so dense and tangled, that it was judged impenetrable
and left unoccupied&mdash;an error of judgment which cost many
lives. General Lane had also recognised the danger of leaving so
wide a gap between Archer and himself, and had so reported, but
without effect, to his divisional commander.</p>
<p>The coppice was triangular in shape, and extended nearly six
hundred yards beyond the embankment. The base, which faced the
Federals, was five hundred yards long. Beyond the apex the ground
was swampy and covered with scrub, and the ridge, depressed at
this point to a level with the plain, afforded no position from
which artillery could command the approach to or issue from this
patch of jungle. A space of seven hundred yards along the front
was thus left undefended by direct fire.</p>
<img src="images/v2p310.gif" width="490" height="681" alt=
"The Field of Fredericksburg"><br>
<br>
 
<p>Early, who with D. H. Hill had marched in shortly after
daybreak, formed the right of the third line, Taliaferro the
left. The division of D. H. Hill, with several batteries, formed
the general reserve, and a portion of Early&rsquo;s artillery was
posted about half a mile in rear of his division, in readiness,
if necessary, to relieve the guns on Prospect Hill.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s line was two thousand six hundred yards in
length, and his infantry 30,000 strong, giving eleven rifles to
the yard; but nearly three-fourths of the army corps, the
divisions of Early, Taliaferro, and D. H. Hill, were in third
line and reserve. Of his one hundred and twenty-three guns only
forty-seven were in position, but the wooded and broken character
of the ground forbade a further deployment of his favourite arm.
His left, near Deep Run, was in close touch with Hood&rsquo;s
division of Longstreet&rsquo;s army corps; and in advance of his
right, already protected by the Massaponax, was Stuart with two
brigades and his horse-</p>
<p class="folio">ON THE BATTLEFIELD  <a name="page 311"><font
size="+1">311</font></a></p>
<p class="one">artillery. One Whitworth gun, a piece of great
range and large calibre, was posted on the wooded heights beyond
the Massaponax, north-east of Yerby&rsquo;s House.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s dispositions were almost identical with those
which he had adopted at the Second Manassas. His whole force was
hidden in the woods; every gun that could find room was ready for
action, and the batteries were deployed in two masses. Instead,
however, of giving each division a definite section of the line,
he had handed over the whole front to A. P. Hill. This
arrangement, however, had been made before D. H. Hill and Early
came up, and with the battle imminent a change was hazardous. In
many respects, moreover, the ground he now occupied resembled
that which he had so successfully defended on August 29 and 30.
There was the wood opposite the centre, affording the enemy a
covered line of approach; the open fields, pasture and stubble,
on either hand; the stream, hidden by timber and difficult of
passage, on the one flank, and Longstreet on the other. But the
position at Fredericksburg was less strong for defence than that
at the Second Manassas, for not only was Jackson&rsquo;s line
within three thousand yards&mdash;a long range but not
ineffective&mdash;of the heavy guns on the Stafford Heights, but
on the bare plain between the railway and the river there was
ample room for the deployment of the Federal field-batteries. At
the Second Manassas, on the other hand, the advantages of the
artillery position had been on the side of the Confederates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with the soldiers of Sharpsburg, ragged indeed
and under-fed, but eager for battle and strong in numbers, there
was no reason to dread the powerful artillery of the foe; and
Jackson&rsquo;s confidence was never higher than when,
accompanied by his staff, he rode along his line of battle. He
was not, however, received by his soldiers with their usual
demonstrations of enthusiastic devotion. In honour of the day he
had put on the uniform with which Stuart had presented him; the
old cadet cap, which had so often waved his men to victory, was
replaced by a head-dress resplendent with gold lace;
&ldquo;Little Sorrel&rdquo; had been deposed in favour of a more
imposing charger; and</p>
<p class="folio">ON THE BATTLEFIELD  <a name="page 312"><font
size="+1">312</font></a></p>
<p class="one">the veterans failed to recognise their commander
until he had galloped past them. A Confederate artillery-man has
given a graphic picture of his appearance when the fight was at
its hottest:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A general officer, mounted upon a superb bay horse and
followed by a single courier, rode up through our guns. Looking
neither to the right nor the left, he rode straight to the front,
halted, and seemed gazing intently on the enemy&rsquo;s line of
battle. The outfit before me, from top to toe, cap, coat,
top-boots, horse and furniture, were all of the new order of
things. But there was something about the man that did not look
so new after all. He appeared to be an old-time friend of all the
turmoil around him. As he had done us the honour to make an
afternoon call on the artillery, I thought it becoming in someone
to say something on the occasion. No one did, however, so,
although a somewhat bashful and weak-kneed youngster, I plucked
up courage enough to venture to remark that those big guns over
the river had been knocking us about pretty considerably during
the day. He quickly turned his head, and I knew in an instant who
it was before me. The clear-cut, chiselled features; the thin,
compressed and determined lips; the calm, steadfast eye; the
countenance to command respect, and in time of war to give the
soldier that confidence he so much craves from a superior
officer, were all there. He turned his head quickly, and looking
me all over, rode up the line and away as quickly and silently as
he came, his little courier hard upon his heels; and this was my
first sight of Stonewall Jackson.rdquo;</p>
<p>From his own lines Jackson passed along the front, drawing the
fire of the Federal skirmishers, who were creeping forward, and
proceeded to the centre of the position, where, on the eminence
which has since borne the name of Lee&rsquo;s Hill, the
Commander-in-Chief, surrounded by his generals, was giving his
last instructions. It was past nine o&rsquo;clock. The sun,
shining out with almost September warmth, was drawing up the mist
which hid the opposing armies; and as the dense white folds
dissolved and rolled sway, the Confederates saw the broad</p>
<p class="folio">THE POMP OF WAR  <a name="page 313"><font size=
"+1">313</font></a></p>
<p class="one">plain beneath them dark with more than 80,000
foes. Of these the left wing, commanded by Franklin, and composed
of 55,000 men and 116 guns, were moving against the Second Corps;
30,000, under Sumner, were forming for attack on Longstreet, and
from the heights of Stafford, where the reserves were posted in
dense masses, a great storm of shot and shell burst upon the
Confederate lines. &ldquo;For once,&rdquo; says Dabney,
&ldquo;war unmasked its terrible proportions with a distinctness
hitherto unknown in the forest-clad landscapes of America, and
the plain of Fredericksburg presented a panorama that was
dreadful in its grandeur.&rdquo; It was then that Longstreet, to
whose sturdy heart the approach of battle seemed always welcome,
said to Jackson, &ldquo;General, do not all those multitudes of
Federals frighten you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall very soon see
whether I shall not frighten them;&rdquo; and with this grim
reply the commander of the Second Corps rode back to meet
Franklin&rsquo;s onset.</p>
<p><span class="date">9 a.m.  </span> The Federals were already
advancing. From Deep Run southward, for more than a mile and a
half, three great lines of battle, accompanied by numerous
batteries, moved steadily forward, powerful enough, to all
appearance, to bear down all opposition by sheer weight of
numbers. &ldquo;On they came,&rdquo; says an eye-witness,
&ldquo;in beautiful order, as if on parade, their bayonets
glistening in the bright sunlight; on they came, waving their
hundreds of regimental flags, which relieved with warm bits of
colouring the dull blue of the columns and the russet tinge of
the wintry landscape, while their artillery beyond the river
continued the cannonade with unabated fury over their heads, and
gave a background of white fleecy smoke, like midsummer clouds,
to the animated picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that
moral force without which physical power, even in its most
terrible form, is but an idle show. Not only were the strength of
the Confederate position, the want of energy in the preliminary
movements, the insecurity of their own situation, but too
apparent to the intelligence of the regimental officers and men,
but they mistrusted their</p>

<p class="one">commander. Northern writers have recorded that the
Army of the Potomac never went down to battle with less alacrity
than on this day at Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>Nor was the order of attack of such a character as to revive
the confidence of the troops. Burnside, deluded by the skill with
which Jackson had hidden his troops into the belief that the
Second Army Corps was still at Port Royal, had instructed
Franklin to seize the ridge with a single division, and
Meade&rsquo;s 4,500 Pennsylvanians were sent forward alone, while
the remainder of the Grand Division, over 50,000 strong, stood
halted on the plain, awaiting the result of this hopeless
man&oelig;uvre.<sup>1</sup> Meade advanced in three lines, each
of a brigade, with skirmishers in front and on the flank, and his
progress was soon checked. No sooner had his first line crossed
the Richmond road than the left was assailed by a well-directed
and raking artillery fire.</p>
<p>Captain Pelham, commanding Stuart&rsquo;s horse-artillery, had
galloped forward by Jackson&rsquo;s orders with his two rifled
guns, and, escorted by a dismounted squadron, had come into
action beyond a marshy stream which ran through a tangled ravine
on the Federal flank. So telling was his fire that the leading
brigade wavered and gave ground; and though Meade quickly brought
up his guns and placed his third brigade <i>en potence</i> in
support, he was unable to continue his forward movement until he
had brushed away his audacious antagonist. The four Pennsylvania
batteries were reinforced by two others; but rapidly changing his
position as often as the Federal gunners found his range, for
more than half an hour Pelham defied their efforts, and for that
space of time arrested the advance of Meade&rsquo;s 4,500
infantry. One of his pieces was soon disabled; but with the
remaining gun, captured from the enemy six months before, he
maintained the unequal fight until his limbers were empty, and he
received peremptory orders from Stuart to withdraw.</p>
<p>On Pelham&rsquo;s retirement, Franklin, bringing several
batteries forward to the Richmond road, for more than</p>
<p class="fnote">1  Franklin&rsquo;s Grand Division consisted of
the 42,800 men, and 12,000 of Hooker&rsquo;s Grand Division had
reinforced him.</p>
<p class="folio">THE BOMBARDMENT  <a name="page 315"><font size=
"+1">315</font></a></p>
<p class="one">half an hour subjected the woods before him to a
heavy cannonade, in which the guns on the Stafford Heights played
a conspicuous part. Hidden, however, by the thick timber,
Jackson&rsquo;s regiments lay secure, unharmed by the tempest
that crashed above them through the leafless branches; and,
reserving their fire for the hostile infantry, his guns were
silent. The general, meanwhile, according to his custom, had
walked far out into the fields to reconnoitre for himself, and
luck favoured the Confederacy on this day of battle. Lieutenant
Smith was his only companion, and a Federal sharpshooter,
suddenly rising from some tall weeds two hundred paces distant,
levelled his rifle and fired. The bullet whistled between their
heads, and Jackson, turning with a smile to his aide-de-camp,
said cheerfully: &ldquo;Mr. Smith, had you not better go to the
rear? They may shoot you.&rdquo; Then, having deliberately noted
the enemy&rsquo;s arrangements, he returned to his station on
Prospect Hill.</p>
<p><span class="date">11.15 a.m.  </span> It was past eleven
before Meade resumed his advance. Covered by the fire of the
artillery, his first line was within eight hundred yards of
Jackson&rsquo;s centre, when suddenly the silent woods awoke to
life. The Confederate batteries, pushing forward from the covert,
came rapidly into action, and the flash and thunder of more than
fifty guns revealed to the astonished Federals the magnitude of
the task they had undertaken. From front and flank came the
scathing fire; the skirmishers were quickly driven in, and on the
closed ranks behind burst the full fury of the storm. Dismayed
and decimated by this fierce and unexpected onslaught,
Meade&rsquo;s brigades broke in disorder and fell back to the
Richmond road.</p>
<p>For the next hour and a half an artillery duel, in which over
400 guns took part, raged over the whole field, and the
Confederate batteries, their position at last revealed, engaged
with spirit the more numerous and powerful ordnance of the enemy.
Then Franklin brought up three divisions to Meade&rsquo;s
support; and from the smouldering ruins of Fredericksburg, three
miles to the northward, beyond the high trees of Hazel Run, the
deep columns of Sumner&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="folio">MEADE AND GIBBON ATTACK  <a name=
"page 316"><font size="+1">316</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Grand Division deployed under the fire of
Longstreet&rsquo;s guns. Sumner&rsquo;s attack had been for some
time in progress before Franklin was in readiness to co-operate.
The battle was now fully developed, and the morning mists had
been succeeded by dense clouds of smoke, shrouding bill and
plain, through which the cannon flashed redly, and the defiant
yells of Longstreet&rsquo;s riflemen, mingled with their rattling
volleys, stirred the pulses of Jackson&rsquo;s veterans. As the
familiar sounds were borne to their ears, it was seen that the
dark lines beyond the Richmond road were moving forward, and the
turn of the Second Corps had come.</p>
<p><span class="date">1 p.m.  </span> It was one o&rsquo;clock,
and Jackson&rsquo;s guns had for the moment ceased their fire.
Meade&rsquo;s Pennsylvanians had rallied. Gibbon&rsquo;s division
had taken post on their right; Biney and Newton were in support;
and Doubleday, facing south, was engaged with Stuart&rsquo;s
dismounted troopers. Twenty-one guns on the right, and thirty on
the left, stationed on the Richmond road, a thousand yards from
the Confederate position, formed a second tier to the heavier
pieces on the heights, and fired briskly on the woods. Preceded
by clouds of skirmishers, Meade and Gibbon advanced in column of
brigades at three hundred paces distance, the whole covering a
front of a thousand yards; and the supporting divisions moved up
to the Richmond road.</p>
<p>When the Federals reached the scene of their former repulse,
Jackson&rsquo;s guns again opened; but without the same effect,
for they were now exposed to the fire of the enemy&rsquo;s
batteries at close range. Even Pelham could do but little; and
the artillery beyond the railroad on Hill&rsquo;s left was
quickly driven in.</p>
<p>Meade&rsquo;s rear brigade was now brought up and deployed on
the left of the first, in the direction of the Massaponax, thus
further extending the front.</p>
<p>The leading brigade made straight for the tongue of woodland
which interposed between Lane and Archer. As they neared the
Confederate line, the Pennsylvanians, masked by the trees, found
that they were no longer exposed to fire, and that the coppice
was unoccupied.</p>
<p class="folio">MEADE AND GIBBON ATTACK  <a name=
"page 317"><font size="+1">317</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Quickly crossing the border, through swamp and
undergrowth they pushed their way, and, bursting from the covert
to the right, fell on the exposed flank of Lane&rsquo;s brigade.
The fight was fierce, but the Southerners were compelled to give
ground, for neither Archer nor Gregg was able to lend
assistance.</p>
<p>Meade&rsquo;s second brigade, though following close upon the
first, had, instead of conforming to the change of direction
against Lane&rsquo;s flank, rushed forward through the wood. Two
hundred paces from the embankment it came in contact with
Archer&rsquo;s left, which was resting on the very edge of the
coppice. The Confederates were taken by surprise. Their front was
secured by a strong skirmish line; but on the flank, as the
thickets appeared impenetrable, neither scouts nor pickets had
been thrown out, and the men were lying with arms piled. Two
regiments, leaping to their feet and attempting to form line to
the left, were broken by a determined charge, and gave way in
disorder. The remainder, however, stood firm, for the Federals,
instead of following up their success in this direction, left
Archer to be dealt with by the third brigade of the division,
which had now reached the railroad, and swept on towards the
military road, where Gregg&rsquo;s brigade was drawn up within
the forest. So thick was the cover, and so limited the view, that
General Gregg, taking the advancing mass for part of
Archer&rsquo;s line retiring, restrained the fire of his men. The
Federals broke upon his right. He himself fell mortally wounded.
His flank regiment, a battalion of conscripts, fled, except one
company, without firing a shot. The two regiments on the opposite
flank, however, were with great readiness turned about, and
changing front inwards, arrested the movement of the enemy along
the rear.</p>
<p>The Federals had now been joined by a portion of the first
brigade, inspirited by their victory over Lane, and the moment,
to all appearance, seemed critical in the extreme for the
Confederates. To the left rear of the attacking column,
Meade&rsquo;s third brigade was held in check by Walker&rsquo;s
batteries and the sturdy Archer, who, notwith-</p>
<p class="folio">THE COUNTERSTROKE  <a name="page 318"><font
size="+1">318</font></a></p>
<p class="one">standing that a strong force had passed beyond his
flank, and had routed two of his regiments, still resolutely held
his ground, and prevented his immediate opponents from joining
the intruding column. To the right rear, opposite Pender,
Gibbon&rsquo;s division had been checked by the fire of the great
battery near Bernard&rsquo;s Cabin; two of his brigades had been
driven back, and the third had with difficulty gained the shelter
of the embankment. So from neither left nor right was immediate
support to be expected by Meade&rsquo;s victorious regiments. But
on the Richmond road were the divisions of Birney and Newton,
with Doubleday&rsquo;s and Sickles&rsquo; not far in rear, and
20,000 bayonets might have been thrown rapidly into the gap which
the Pennsylvanians had so vigorously forced. Yet Jackson&rsquo;s
equanimity was undisturbed. The clouds of smoke and the thick
timber hid the fighting in the centre from his post of
observation on Prospect Hill, and the first intimation of the
enemy&rsquo;s success was brought by an aide-de-camp, galloping
wildly up the slope. &ldquo;General,&rdquo; he exclaimed in
breathless haste, &ldquo;the enemy have broken through
Archer&rsquo;s left, and General Gregg says he must have help, or
he and General Archer will both lose their position.&rdquo;
Jackson turned round quietly, and without the least trace of
excitement in either voice or manner, sent orders to Early and
Taliaferro, in third line, to advance with the bayonet and clear
the front. Then, with rare self-restraint, for the fighting
instinct was strong within him, and the danger was so threatening
as to have justified his personal interference, he raised his
field-glasses and resumed his scrutiny of the enemy&rsquo;s
reserves on the Richmond road.</p>
<p><span class="date">1.45 p.m.  </span> His confidence in his
lieutenants was not misplaced. Early&rsquo;s division, already
deployed in line, came forward with a rush, and the Stonewall
Brigade, responding with alacrity to Jackson&rsquo;s summons, led
the advance of Taliaferro.</p>
<p>The counterstroke was vigorous. Meade&rsquo;s brigades had
penetrated to the heart of the Confederate position, but their
numbers were reduced to less than 2,000 bayonets; in the fierce
fighting and dense thickets they had lost all semblance of
cohesion, and not a single regiment had</p>
<p class="folio">THE COUNTERSTROKE  <a name="page 319"><font
size="+1">319</font></a></p>
<p class="one">supported them. The men looked round in vain for
help, and the forest around them resounded with the yells of the
Confederate reinforcements. Assailed in front and flank by a
destructive fire, the Pennsylvanians were rapidly borne back.
Hill&rsquo;s second line joined in Early&rsquo;s advance. Gibbon
was strongly attacked. Six brigades, sweeping forward from the
forest, dashed down the slopes, and in a few moments the broken
remnants of the Federal divisions were dispersing in panic across
the plain. As the enemy fled the Confederate gunners,
disregarding the shells of Franklin&rsquo;s batteries, poured a
heavy fire into the receding mass; and although instructions had
been given that the counterstroke was not to pass the railroad,
Hoke&rsquo;s and Atkinson&rsquo;s brigades,<sup>1</sup> carried
away by success and deaf to all orders, followed in swift
pursuit. Some of Birney&rsquo;s regiments, tardily coming forward
to Meade&rsquo;s support, were swept away, and the yelling line
of grey infantry, shooting down the fugitives and taking many
prisoners, pressed on towards the Richmond road. There the
remainder of Birney&rsquo;s division was drawn up, protected by
the breast-high bank, and flanked by artillery; yet it seemed for
a moment as if the two Confederate brigades would carry all
before them.</p>
<p>The troops of Meade and Gibbon were streaming in confusion to
the rear. Two batteries had been abandoned, and before
Hake&rsquo;s onset the left of Birney&rsquo;s infantry gave
ground for fifty yards. But the rash advance had reached its
climax. Unsupported, and with empty cartridge-boxes, the
Southerners were unable to face the fire from the road; sixteen
guns had opened on them with canister; and after suffering heavy
losses in killed, wounded, and prisoners, they withdrew in
disorder but unpursued.</p>
<p>The success of the Second Army Corps was greater than even
Jackson realised. Meade and Gibbon had lost 4,000 officers and
men; and it was not till late in the afternoon that they were
rallied on the river bank. The casualties in Birney&rsquo;s
division swelled the total to 5,000, and the Confederate
counterstroke had inflicted a</p>
<p class="fnote">1  Of Early&rsquo;s Division.</p>
<p class="folio">THE COUNTERSTROKE  <a name="page 320"><font
size="+1">320</font></a></p>
<p class="one">heavier blow than the tale of losses indicates.
Not only the troops which had been engaged, but those who had
witnessed their defeat, who had seen them enter the enemy&rsquo;s
position, and who knew they should have been supported, were much
disheartened.</p>
<p><span class="date">2.30 p.m.  </span> At 2.30 p.m., soon after
the repulse of Hake and Atkinson, Burnside, having just witnessed
the signal failure of a fourth assault on Longstreet, sent an
urgent order to Franklin to renew his attack. Franklin made no
response. He had lost all confidence both in his superior and his
men, and he took upon himself to disobey.</p>
<p>On the Confederate side Taliaferro and Early, with part of the
Light Division, now held the railway embankment and the skirt of
the woods. D. H. Hill was brought up into third line, and the
shattered brigades of A. P. Hill were withdrawn to the rear.
During the rest of the afternoon the skirmishers were actively
engaged, but although Jackson&rsquo;s victorious soldiery long
and eagerly expected a renewal of the assault, the enemy refused
to be again tempted to close quarters.</p>
<p>On the left, meanwhile, where the battle still raged, the
Confederates were equally successful. Against an impregnable
position 40,000 Northerners were madly hurled by the general of
Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s choice. By those hapless and stout-hearted
soldiers, sacrificed to incompetency, a heroism was displayed
which won the praise and the pity of their opponents. The attack
was insufficiently prepared, and feebly supported, by the
artillery. The troops were formed on a narrow front.
Marye&rsquo;s Hill, the strongest portion of the position, where
the Confederate infantry found shelter behind a stout stone wall,
and numerous batteries occupied the commanding ground in rear,
was selected for assault. Neither feint nor demonstration, the
ordinary expedients by which the attacker seeks to distract the
attention and confuse the efforts of the defence, was made use
of; and yet division after division, with no abatement of
courage, marched in good order over the naked plain, dashed
forward with ever-thinning ranks, and then, receding sullenly
before the</p>
<p class="folio">THE COUNTERSTROKE  <a name="page 321"><font
size="+1">321</font></a></p>
<p class="one">storm of fire, left, within a hundred yards of the
stone wall, a long line of writhing forms to mark the limit of
their advance.</p>
<p><span class="date">3 p.m.</span> Two army corps had been
repulsed by Longstreet with fearful slaughter when Meade and
Gibbon gave way before Jackson&rsquo;s counterstroke, and by
three o&rsquo;clock nearly one-half of the Federal army was
broken and demoralised. The time appeared to have come for a
general advance of the Confederates. Before Fredericksburg, the
wreck of Sumner&rsquo;s Grand Division was still clinging to such
cover as the ground afforded. On the Richmond road, in front of
Jackson, Franklin had abandoned all idea of the offensive, and
was bringing up his last reserves to defend his line. The
Confederates, on the other hand, were in the highest spirits, and
had lost but few.</p>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s arrangements, however, had not included
preparation for a great counterstroke, and such a movement is not
easily improvised. The position had been occupied for defensive
purposes alone. There was no general reserve, no large and intact
force which could have moved to the attack immediately the
opportunity offered. &ldquo;No skill,&rdquo; says Longstreet,
&ldquo;could have marshalled our troops for offensive operations
in time to meet the emergency. My line was long and over broken
country, so much so that the troops could not be promptly handled
in offensive operations. Jackson&rsquo;s corps was in mass, and
could he have anticipated the result of my battle, he would have
been justified in pressing Franklin to the river when the battle
of the latter was lost. Otherwise, pursuit would have been as
unwise as the attack he had just driven off. It is well known
that after driving off attacking forces, if immediate pursuit can
be made, so that the victors can go along with the retreating
forces pell-mell, it is well enough to do so; but the attack
should be immediate. To follow a success by counter-attack
against the enemy in position is
problematical.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Moreover, so large was the battle-field, so limited the view
by reason of the woods, and with such ease had the</p>
<p class="fnote">1  <i>Battles and Leaders,</i> vol. iii, pp.
82&ndash;3.</p>
<p class="folio">DISAPPOINTMENT  <a name="page 322"><font size=
"+1">322</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Federal attacks been repulsed, that General Lee
was unaware of the extent of his success. Ignorant, too, as he
necessarily was, of the mistrust and want of confidence in its
leaders with which the Federal army was infected, he was far from
suspecting what a strong ally he had in the hearts of his
enemies; while, on the other hand, the inaccessible batteries on
the Stafford Heights were an outward and visible token of
unabated strength.</p>
<p>Jackson, however, although the short winter day was already
closing in, considered that the attempt was worth making. About 3
p.m. he had seen a feeble attack on the Confederate centre
repulsed by Hood and Pender, and about the same time he received
information of Longstreet&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Franklin, meanwhile, was reforming his lines behind the high
banks of the Richmond road, and the approach of his reserves,
plainly visible from the Confederate position, seemed to presage
a renewed attack. &ldquo;I waited some time,&rdquo; says Jackson,
&ldquo;to receive it, but he making no forward movement, I
determined, if prudent, to do so myself. The artillery of the
enemy was so judiciously posted as to make an advance of our
troops across the plain very hazardous; yet it was so promising
of good results, if successfully executed, as to induce me to
make preparations for the attempt. In order to guard against
disaster, the infantry was to be preceded by artillery, and the
movement postponed until late in the afternoon, so that if
compelled to retire, it would be under cover of the
night.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s decision was not a little influenced by
Stuart, or rather by the reports which Stuart, who had sent out
staff officers to keep the closest watch on the enemy&rsquo;s
movements, had been able to furnish of the demoralised condition
of a great part of Franklin&rsquo;s force. The cavalry general,
as soon as he verified the truth of these reports in person,
galloped off to confer with Jackson on Prospect Hill, and a
message was at once sent to Lee, requesting permission for an
advance. A single cannon shot was to be the signal for a general
attack, which Stuart, striking the</p>
<p class="fnote">1  <i>Jackson&rsquo;s Reports,</i> O.R., vol.
xxi, p. 634.</p>
<p class="folio">DISAPPOINTMENT  <a name="page 323"><font size=
"+1">323</font></a></p>
<p class="one">enemy in flank, was to initiate with his two
brigades and the lighter guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returning to our position,&rdquo; to quote
Stuart&rsquo;s chief of staff, &ldquo;we awaited in anxious
silence the desired signal; but minute after minute passed by,
and the dark veil of the winter night began to envelop the
valley, when Stuart, believing that the summons agreed upon had
been given, issued the order to advance. Off we went into the
gathering darkness, our sharpshooters driving their opponents
easily before them, and Pelham with his guns, pushing ahead at a
trot, giving them a few shots whenever the position seemed
favourable, and then again pressing forward. This lasted about
twenty minutes, when the fire of the enemy&rsquo;s infantry began
to be more and more destructive, and other fresh batteries opened
upon us. Still all remained silent upon our main line. Our
situation had become, indeed, a critical one, when a courier from
General Jackson galloped up at full speed, bringing the order for
Stuart to retreat as quickly as he could to his original
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under cover of the night this retrograde movement was effected
without loss; and the cavalry, as they marched back, saw the
camp-fires kindling on the skirts of the forest, and the infantry
digging intrenchments by the fitful glare.</p>
<p>The Second Corps had not come into action. Jackson had issued
orders that every gun, of whatever calibre or range, which was
not disabled should be brought to the front and open fire at
sunset; and that as soon as the enemy showed signs of wavering,
the infantry should charge with fixed bayonets, and sweep the
invaders into the river. Hood&rsquo;s division, which had been
temporarily placed at his disposal, was instructed to
co-operate.<sup>1</sup> It appears, however, that it had not been
easy, in the short space of daylight still available, to remedy
the confusion into which the Confederates had been thrown by
Meade&rsquo;s attack and their own counterstroke. The divisions
were to some extent mixed up. Several regiments had been broken,
and the ammunition of both infantry and artillery needed
replenishment.</p>
<p class="fnote">1  <i>Advance and Retreat,</i>
Lieutenant-General J. B. Hood, p. 50.</p>
<p class="folio">DISAPPOINTMENT  <a name="page 324"><font size=
"+1">324</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Moreover, it was difficult in the extreme to bring
the batteries forward through the forest; and, when they
eventually arrived, the strength of the Federal position was at
once revealed. Franklin&rsquo;s line was defended by a hundred
and sixteen field pieces, generally of superior metal to those of
the Confederates, and the guns on the Stafford Heights, of which
at least thirty bore upon Jackson&rsquo;s front, were still in
action. As the first Confederate battery advanced, this great
array of artillery, which had been for some time comparatively
quiet, reopened with vigour, and, to use Jackson&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;so completely swept our front as to satisfy me that the
proposed movement should be abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was not yet at the end of his resources. A strong
position, which cannot be turned, is not always impregnable. If
the ground be favourable, and few obstacles exist, a night attack
with the bayonet, especially if the enemy be exhausted or
half-beaten, has many chances of success; and during the evening
Jackson made arrangements for such a movement. &ldquo;He asked
me,&rdquo; says Dr. McGuire, &ldquo;how many yards of bandaging I
had, and when I replied that I did not know the exact number, but
that I had enough for another fight, he seemed a little worried
at my lack of information and showed his annoyance. I repeated
rather shortly, &lsquo;I have enough for another battle,&rsquo;
meaning to imply that this was all that it was necessary for him
to know. I then asked him: &lsquo;Why do you want to know how
much bandaging I have?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;I want a yard of
bandaging to put on the arm of every soldier in this
night&rsquo;s attack, so that the men may know each other from
the enemy.&rsquo; I told him I had not enough cotton cloth for
any such purpose, and that he would have to take a piece of the
shirt tail of each soldier to supply the cloth, but,
unfortunately, half of them had no shirts! The expedient was
never tried. General Lee decided that the attack would be too
hazardous.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>That night both armies lay on their arms. Burnside,</p>
<p class="fnote">1  Letter to the author.</p>
<p class="folio">GENERAL GREGG&rsquo;S CONDITION  <a name=
"page 325"><font size="+1">325</font></a></p>
<p class="one">notwithstanding that he spent several hours
amongst the troops before Fredericksburg, and found that both
officers and men were opposed to further attack, decided to renew
the battle the next day. His arrangements became known to Lee, an
officer or orderly carrying dispatches having strayed within the
Confederate outposts,<sup>1</sup> and the Southern generals
looked forward, on the morning of the 14th, to a fresh attack, a
more crushing repulse, and a general counterstroke.</p>
<p>Such cheerful anticipations, however, so often entertained by
generals holding a strong defensive position, are but seldom
realised, and Fredericksburg was no exception. The Confederates
spent the night in diligent preparation. Supplies of ammunition
were brought up and distributed, the existing defences were
repaired, abattis cut and laid, and fresh earthworks thrown up.
Jackson, as usual on the eve of battle, was still working while
others rested. Until near midnight he sat up writing and
dispatching orders; then, throwing himself, booted and spurred,
on his camp bed, he slept for two or three hours, when he again
arose, lighted his candle, and resumed his writing. Before four
o&rsquo;clock he sent to his medical director to inquire as to
the condition of General Gregg. Dr. McGuire reported that his
case was hopeless, and Jackson requested that he would go over
and see that he had everything he wished. Somewhat against his
will, for there were many wounded who required attention, the
medical officer rode off, but scarcely had he entered the
farmhouse where Gregg was lying, than he heard the tramp of
horses, and Jackson himself dismounted on the threshold. The
brigadier, it appears, had lately fallen under the ban of his
displeasure; but from the moment his condition was reported,
Jackson forgot everything but the splendid services he had
rendered on so many hard-fought fields; and in his anxiety that
every memory should be effaced which might embitter his last
moments, he had followed Dr. McGuire to his bedside.</p>
<p>The interview was brief, and the dying soldier was</p>

Virginian homestead, where, in the dark hours of the chill
December morning, the life of a strong man, of a gallant comrade,
of an accomplished gentleman, and of an unselfish
patriot&mdash;for Gregg was all these&mdash;was slowly ebbing,
made a deeper impression on those who witnessed it than the
accumulated horrors of the battle-field. Sadly and silently the
general and his staff officer rode back through the forest, where
the troops were already stirring round the smouldering
camp-fires. Their thoughts were sombre. The Confederacy, with a
relatively slender population, could ill spare such men as Gregg.
And yet Jackson, though yielding to the depression of the moment,
and deploring the awful sacrifices which the defence of her
liberties imposed upon the South, was in no melting mood. Dr.
McGuire, when they reached headquarters, put a question as to the
best means of coping with the overwhelming numbers of the enemy.
&ldquo;Kill them, sir! kill every man!&rdquo; was the reply of
the stern soldier who but just now, with words of tender sympathy
and Christian hope, had bade farewell to his dying comrade.</p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 14  </span> But on December 14, as on
the morrow of Sharpsburg, the Confederates were doomed to
disappointment. &ldquo;Darkness still prevailed,&rdquo; writes
Stuart&rsquo;s chief of the staff, &ldquo;when we mounted our
horses and again hastened to Prospect Hill, the summit of which
we reached just in time to see the sun rising, and unveiling, as
it dispersed the haze, the long lines of the Federal army, which
once more stood in full line of battle between our own position
and the river. I could not withhold my admiration as I looked
down upon the well-disciplined ranks of our antagonists,
astonished that these troops now offering so bold a front should
be the same whom not many hours since I had seen in complete
flight and disorder. The skirmishers of the two armies were not
much more than a hundred yards apart, concealed from each
other&rsquo;s view by the high grass in which they were lying,
and above which, from time to time, rose a small cloud of blue
smoke, telling that a shot had been fired. As the boom of
artillery began</p>
<p class="folio">THE FEDERALS RETREAT  <a name="page 327"><font
size="+1">327</font></a></p>
<p class="one">to sound from different parts of the line, and the
attack might be expected every minute, each hastened to his
post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though the skirmishing at times grew hotter, and the fire
of the artillery more rapid, long intervals of silence succeeded,
until it at length became apparent to the Confederates that the
enemy, though well prepared to resist attack, was determined not
to fight outside his breastworks. Burnside, indeed, giving way to
the remonstrances of his subordinates, had abandoned all idea of
further aggressive action, and unless Lee should move forward,
had determined to recross the Potomac.</p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 15  </span> The next morning saw the
armies in the same positions, and the Federal wounded, many of
whom had been struck down nearly forty-eight hours before, still
lying untended between the hostile lines. It was not till now
that Burnside admitted his defeat by sending a flag of truce with
a request that he might be allowed to bury his
dead.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The same night a fierce storm swept the valley of the
Rappahannock, and the Army of the Potomac repassed the bridges,
evading, under cover of the elements, the observation of the
Confederate patrols.</p>
<p>The retreat was effected with a skill which did much credit to
the Federal staff. Within fourteen hours 100,000 troops, with the
whole of their guns, ambulances, and ammunition waggons, were
conveyed across the Rappahannock;</p>
<p class="fnote">1  &ldquo;When the flag of truce,&rdquo; says
Major Hotchkiss, &ldquo;was received by General Jackson, he asked
me for paper and pencil, and began a letter to be sent in reply;
but after writing a few lines he handed the paper back, and sent
a personal message by Captain Smith.&rdquo;<br>
     Captain Smith writes: &ldquo;The general said to me, before
I went out to meet Colonel Sumner, representing the Federals:
&lsquo;If you are asked who is in command of your right, do not
tell them I am, and be guarded in your remarks.&rsquo; It so
happened that Colonel Sumner was the brother-in-law of Colonel
Long, an officer on General Lee&rsquo;s staff. While we were
together, another Federal officer named Junkin rode up. He was
the brother or cousin of Jackson&rsquo;s first wife, and I had
known him before the war. After some conversation, Junkin asked
me to give his regards to General Jackson, and to deliver a
message from the Reverend Dr. Junkin, the father of his first
wife. I replied, &lsquo;I will do so with pleasure when I meet
General Jackson.&rsquo; Junkin smiled and said: &lsquo;It is not
worth while for you to try to deceive us. We know that General
Jackson is in front of us.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="folio">THE FEDERALS RETREAT  <a name="page 328"><font
size="+1">328</font></a></p>
<p class="one">but there remained on the south bank sufficient
evidence to show that the Army of the Potomac had not escaped
unscathed. When the morning broke the dead lay thick upon the
field; arms and accoutrements, the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
defeat, were strewed in profusion on every hand, and the ruined
houses of Fredericksburg were filled with wounded. Burnside lost
in the battle 12,647 men.</p>

<p>No attempt was made by the Confederates to follow the enemy
across the Rappahannock. The upper fords were open; but the river
was rising fast, and the Army of the Potomac, closely
concentrated and within a few miles of Aquia Creek, was too large
to be attacked, and too close to its base to permit effective
man&oelig;uvres, which might induce it to divide, against its
line of communications. The exultation of the Southern soldiers
in their easy victory was dashed by disappointment.
Burnside&rsquo;s escape had demonstrated the fallacy of one of
the so-called rules of war. The great river which lay behind him
during the battle of Fredericksburg had proved his salvation
instead of&mdash;as it theoretically should&mdash;his ruin. Over
the six bridges his troops had more lines of retreat than is
usually the case when roads only are available; and these lines
of retreat were secure, protected from the Confederate cavalry by
the river, and from the infantry and artillery by the batteries
on the Stafford Heights. Had the battle been fought on the North
Anna, thirty-six miles from Fredericksburg, the result might have
been very different. A direct counterstroke would possibly have
been no more practicable</p>
<p class="folio">BURNSIDE&rsquo;S ESCAPE  <a name=
"page 330"><font size="+1">330</font></a></p>
<p class="one">than on the Rappahannock, for the superior numbers
of the enemy, and his powerful artillery, could not have been
disregarded. Nor would a direct pursuit have been a certain means
of making success decisive; the rear of a retreating army, as the
Confederates had found to their cost at Malvern Hill, is usually
its strongest part. But a pursuit directed against the flanks,
striking the line of retreat, cutting off the supply and
ammunition trains, and blocking the roads, a pursuit such as
Jackson had organised when he drove Banks from the Valley, if
conducted with vigour, seldom fails in its effect. And who would
have conducted such an operation with greater skill and energy
than Stuart, at the head of his 9,000 horsemen? Who would have
supported Stuart more expeditiously than the
&ldquo;foot-cavalry&rdquo; of the Second Army Corps?</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s position at Fredericksburg, strong as it might
appear, was exceedingly disadvantageous. A position which an army
occupies with a view to decisive battle should fulfil four
requirements:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.  It should not be too strong, or the enemy will not attack
it.</p>
<p>2.  It should give cover to the troops both from view and fire
from artillery, and have a good field of fire.</p>
<p>3.  It should afford facilities for counterstroke.</p>
<p>4.  It should afford facilities for pursuit.</p>
<p>Of these Lee&rsquo;s battle-field fulfilled but the first and
second. It would have been an admirable selection if the sole
object of the Confederates had been to gain time, or to prevent
the enemy establishing himself south of the Rappahannock; but to
encompass the destruction of the enemy&rsquo;s whole army it was
as ill adapted as Wellington&rsquo;s position at Torres Vedras,
at Busaco, or at Fuentes d&rsquo;Onor. But while Wellington in
taking up these positions had no further end in view than holding
the French in check, the situation of the Confederacy was such
that a decisive victory was eminently desirable. Nothing was to
be gained by gaining time. The South could furnish Lee with no
further reinforcements. Every able-bodied man was in the service
of his country; and it was perfectly certain that the Western</p>
<p class="folio">COMMENTS  <a name="page 331"><font size=
"+1">331</font></a></p>
<p class="one">armies, although they had been generally
successful during the past year, would never be permitted by Mr.
Davis to leave the valley of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The Army of Northern Virginia was not likely to be stronger or
more efficient. Equipped with the spoils of many victories, it
was more on a level with the enemy than had hitherto been the
case. The ranks were full. The men were inured to hardships and
swift marches; their health was proof against inclement weather,
and they knew their work on the field of battle. The artillery
had recently been reorganised. During the Peninsular campaign the
batteries had been attached to the infantry brigades, and the
indifferent service they had often rendered had been attributed
to the difficulty of collecting the scattered units, and in
handling them in combination. Formed into battalions of four or
six batteries a large number of guns was now attached to each of
the divisions, and each army corps had a strong reserve; so that
the concentration of a heavy force of artillery on any part of a
position became a feasible operation. The cavalry, so admirably
commanded by Stuart, Hampton, and the younger Lees, was not less
hardy or efficient than the infantry, and the <i>moral</i> of the
soldiers of every arm, founded on confidence in themselves not
less than on confidence in their leaders, was never higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the truce had been agreed upon,&rdquo; says
Captain Smith, &ldquo;litter-bearers to bring away the dead and
wounded were selected from the command of General Bodes. When
they had fallen in, General Bodes said to them: &lsquo;Now, boys,
those Yankees are going to ask you questions, and you must not
tell them anything. Be very careful about this.&rsquo; At this
juncture one of the men spoke up, and said, &lsquo;General,
can&rsquo;t we tell them that we whipped them yesterday?&rsquo;
Bodes replied, laughing: &lsquo;Yes, yes! you can tell them
that.&rsquo; Immediately another man spoke up: &lsquo;General,
can&rsquo;t we tell them that we can whip them tomorrow and the
day after?&rsquo; Bodes again laughed, and sent those
incorrigible jokers off with: &lsquo;Yes, yes! go on, go on! Tell
them what you please.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>The Army of the Potomac, on the other hand, was not</p>
<p class="folio">COMMENTS  <a name="page 332"><font size=
"+1">332</font></a></p>
<p class="one">likely to become weaker or less formidable if time
were allowed it to recuperate. It had behind it enormous
reserves. 60,000 men had been killed, wounded, or captured since
the battle of Kernstown, and yet the ranks were as full as when
McClellan first marched on Richmond. Many generals had
disappeared; but those who remained were learning their trade;
and the soldiers, although more familiar with defeat than
victory, showed little diminution of martial ardour. Nor had the
strain of the war sapped the resources of the North. Her trade,
instead of dwindling, had actually increased; and the gaps made
in the population by the Confederate bullets were more than made
good by a constant influx of immigrants from Europe.</p>
<p>It was not by partial triumphs, not by the slaughter of a few
brigades, by defence without counterstroke, by victories without
pursuit, that a Power of such strength and vitality could be
compelled to confess her impotence. Whether some overwhelming
disaster, a Jena or a Waterloo, followed by instant invasion,
would have subdued her stubborn spirit is problematical. Rome
survived Cann&aelig;, Scotland Flodden, and France Sedan. But in
some such crowning mercy lay the only hope of the Confederacy,
and had the Army of the Potomac, ill-commanded as it was, been
drawn forward to the North Anna, it might have been utterly
destroyed. Half-hearted strategy, which aims only at repulsing
the enemy&rsquo;s attack, is not the path to king-making victory;
it is not by such feeble means that States secure or protect
their independence. To occupy a position where Stuart&rsquo;s
cavalry was powerless, where the qualities which made Lee&rsquo;s
infantry so formidable&mdash;the impetuosity of their attack, the
swiftness of their marches&mdash;had no field for display, and
where the enemy had free scope for the employment of his
artillery, his strongest arm, was but to postpone the evil day.
It had been well for the Confederacy if Stonewall Jackson, whose
resolute strategy had but one aim, and that aim the annihilation
of the enemy, had been the supreme director of her councils. To
paraphrase Mahan: &ldquo;The strategic mistake (in occupying a
position for which pursuit was impracticable) neutralised the
tactical advantage</p>
<p class="folio">FALSE STRATEGY  <a name="page 333"><font size=
"+1">333</font></a></p>
<p class="one">gained, thus confirming the military maxim that a
strategic mistake is more serious and far-reaching in its effects
than an error in tactics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee, however, was fettered by the orders of the Cabinet; and
Mr. Davis and his advisers, more concerned with the importance of
retaining an area of country which still furnished supplies than
of annihilating the Army of the Potomac, and relying on European
intervention rather than on the valour of the Southern soldier,
were responsible for the occupation of the Fredericksburg
position. In extenuation of their mistake it may, however, be
admitted that the advantages of concentration on the North Anna
were not such as would impress themselves on the civilian mind,
while the surrender of territory would undoubtedly have
embarrassed both the Government and the supply department.
Moreover, at the end of November, it might have been urged that
if Burnside were permitted to possess himself of Fredericksburg,
it was by no means certain that he would advance on Richmond;
establishing himself in winter quarters, he might wait until the
weather improved, controlling, in the meantime, the resources and
population of that portion of Virginia which lay within his
reach.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as events went far to prove, Mr. Davis would
have done wisely had he accepted the advice of the soldiers on
the spot. His strategical glance was less comprehensive than that
of Lee and Jackson. In the first place, they knew that if
Burnside proposed going into winter quarters, he would not
deliberately place the Rappahannock between himself and his base,
nor halt with the great forest of Spotsylvania on his flank. In
the second place, there could be no question but that the
Northern Government and the Northern people would impel him
forward. The tone of the press was unmistakable; and the very
reason that Burnside had been appointed to command was because
McClellan was so slow to move. In the third place, both Lee and
Jackson saw the need of decisive victory. With them questions of
strategic dispositions, offering chances of such victory, were of
more importance than questions</p>
<p class="folio">FALSE STRATEGY  <a name="page 334"><font size=
"+1">334</font></a></p>
<p class="one">of supply or internal politics. They knew with
what rapidity the Federal soldiers recovered their <i>moral</i>;
and they realised but too keenly the stern determination which
inspired the North. They had seen the hosts of invasion retire in
swift succession, stricken and exhausted, before their victorious
bayonets. Thousands of prisoners had been marched to Richmond;
thousands of wounded, abandoned on the battle-field, had been
paroled; guns, waggons and small arms, enough to equip a great
army, had been captured; and general after general had been
reduced to the ignominy that awaits a defeated leader.
Fr&eacute;mont and Shields had disappeared; Banks was no longer
in the field; Porter was waiting trial; McDowell had gone; Pope
had gone, and McClellan; and yet the Army of the Potomac still
held its ground, the great fleets still kept their stations, the
capture of Richmond was still the objective of the Union
Government, and not for a single moment had Lincoln wavered from
his purpose.</p>
<p>It will not be asserted that either Lee or Jackson fathomed
the source of this unconquerable tenacity, They had played with
effect on the fears of Lincoln; they had recognised in him the
motive power of the Federal hosts; but they had not yet learned,
for the Northern people themselves had not yet learned it, that
they were opposed by an adversary whose resolution was as
unyielding as their own, who loved the Union even as they loved
Virginia, and who ruled the nation with the same tact and skill
that they ruled their soldiers.</p>
<p>In these pages Mr. Lincoln has not been spared. He made
mistakes, and he himself would have been the last to claim
infallibility. He had entered the White House with a rich
endowment of common-sense, a high sense of duty, and an
extraordinary knowledge of the American character; but his
ignorance of statesmanship directing arms was great, and his
military errors were numerous. Putting these aside, his tenure of
office during the dark days of &rsquo;61 and &rsquo;62 had been
marked by the very highest political sagacity; his courage and
his patriotism had sustained the nation in its distress; and in
spite of every obstacle he was gradually</p>
<p class="folio">THE EDICT OF EMANCIPATION  <a name=
"page 335"><font size="+1">335</font></a></p>
<p class="one">bringing into being a unity of sympathy and of
purpose, which in the early days of the war had seemed an
impossible ideal. Not the least politic of his measures was the
edict of emancipation, published after the battle of Sharpsburg.
It was not a measure without flaw. It contained paragraphs which
might fairly be interpreted, and were so interpreted by the
Confederates, as inciting the negroes to rise against their
masters, thus exposing to all the horrors of a servile
insurrection, with its accompaniments of murder and outrage, the
farms and plantations where the women and children of the South
lived lonely and unprotected. But if the edict served only to
embitter the Southerners, to bind the whole country together in a
still closer league of resistance, and to make peace except by
conquest impossible, it was worth the price. The party in the
North which fought for the re-establishment of the Union had
carried on the war with but small success. The tale of reverses
had told at last upon recruiting. Men were unwilling to come
forward; and those who were bribed by large bounties to join the
armies were of a different character to the original volunteer.
Enthusiasm in the cause was fast diminishing when Lincoln, purely
on his own initiative, proclaimed emancipation, and, investing
the war with the dignity of a crusade, inspired the soldier with
a new incentive, and appealed to a feeling which had not yet been
stirred. Many Northerners had not thought it worth while to fight
for the re-establishment of the Union on the basis of the
Constitution. If slavery was to be permitted to continue they
preferred separation; and these men were farmers and
agriculturists, the class which furnished the best soldiers, men
of American birth, for the most part abolitionists, and ready to
fight for the principle they had so much at heart. It is true
that the effect of the edict was not at once apparent. It was not
received everywhere with acclamation. The army had small sympathy
with the coloured race, and the political opponents of the
President accused him vehemently of unconstitutional action.
Their denunciations, however, missed the mark. The letter of the
Constitution, as Mr. Lincoln clearly saw, had ceased to be</p>
<p class="folio">THE EDICT OF EMANCIPATION  <a name=
"page 336"><font size="+1">336</font></a></p>
<p class="one">regarded, at least by the great bulk of the
people, with superstitious reverence.</p>
<p>They had learned to think more of great principles than of
political expedients; and if the defence of their hereditary
rights had welded the South into a nation, the assertion of a
still nobler principle, the liberty of man, placed the North on a
higher plane, enlisted the sympathy of Europe, and completed the
isolation of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>But although Lee and Jackson had not yet penetrated the
political genius of their great antagonist, they rated at its
true value the vigour displayed by his Administration, and they
saw that something more was wanting to wrest their freedom from
the North than a mere passive resistance to the invader&rsquo;s
progress. Soon after the battle of Fredericksburg, Lee went to
Richmond and laid proposals for an aggressive campaign before the
President. &ldquo;He was assured, however,&rdquo; says General
Longstreet, &ldquo;that the war was virtually over, and that we
need not harass our troops by marches and other hardships. Gold
had advanced in New York to two hundred premium, and we were told
by those in the Confederate capital that in thirty or forty days
we would be recognised (by the European Powers) and peace
proclaimed. General Lee did not share this
belief.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 18  </span> So Jackson, who had hoped
to return to Winchester, was doomed to the inaction of winter
quarters on the Rappahannock, for with Burnside&rsquo;s repulse
operations practically ceased. The Confederate cavalry, however,
did not at once abandon hostilities. On December 18, Hampton
marched his brigade as far as the village of Occoquan, bringing
off 150 prisoners and capturing a convoy.</p>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 26  </span> And on December 26 Stuart
closed his record for 1862 by leading 1,800 troopers far to the
Federal rear. After doing much damage in the district about
Occoquan and Dumfries, twenty miles from Burnside&rsquo;s

<p class="one">message to General Meigs, Quartermaster-General at
Washington, to the effect that the mules furnished to
Burnside&rsquo;s army were of such bad quality that he was
embarrassed in taking the waggons he had captured into the
Confederate lines, and requesting that a better class of animal
might be supplied in future, he returned by long marches through
Warrenton to Culpeper Court House, escaping pursuit, and bringing
with him a large amount of plunder and many prisoners. From the
afternoon of December 26 to nightfall on December 31 he rode one
hundred and fifty miles, losing 28 officers and men in skirmishes
with detachments of the Federal cavalry. He had contrived to
throw a great part of the troops sent to meet him into utter
confusion by intercepting their telegrams, and answering them

<p>Near the end of January, Burnside made a futile attempt to
march his army round Lee&rsquo;s flank by way of Ely&rsquo;s and
Germanna Fords. The weather, however, was inclement; the roads
were in a fearful condition, and the troops experienced such

Burnside, in consequence of the strong representations made by
his lieutenants to the President, was superseded. General Hooker,
the dashing fighter of the Antietam, replaced him in command of
the Army of the Potomac, and the Federal troops went into winter
quarters about Falmouth, where, on the opposite shore of the
Rappahannock, within full view of the sentries, stood a row of
finger-posts, on which the Confederate soldiers had painted the
taunting legend, &ldquo;This way to Richmond!&rdquo;</p>
