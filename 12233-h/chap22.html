<h2>STONEWALL JACKSON</h2>

<br>
 Chapter XXII<br>
<br>
 <font size="-1"><b>WINTER QUARTERS</b></font></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<p><span class="date">1863  </span> During the long interval
which intervened between the battle of Fredericksburg and the
next campaign, Jackson employed himself in preparing the reports
of his battles, which had been called for by the
Commander-in-Chief. They were not compiled in their entirety by
his own hand. He was no novice at literary composition, and his
pen, as his letter-book shows, was not that of an unready writer.
He had a good command of language, and that power of clear and
concise expression which every officer in command of a large
force, a position naturally entailing a large amount of
confidential correspondence, must necessarily possess. But the
task now set him was one of no ordinary magnitude. Since the
battle of Kernstown, the report of which had been furnished in
April 1862, the time had been too fully occupied to admit of the
crowded events being placed on record, and more than one-half of
the division, brigade, and regimental commanders who had been
engaged in the operations of the period had been killed. Nor,
even now, did his duties permit him the necessary leisure to
complete the work without assistance. On his requisition,
therefore, Colonel Charles Faulkner, who had been United States
Minister to France before the war, was attached to his staff for
the purpose of collecting the reports of the subordinate
commanders, and combining them in the proper form. The rough
drafts were carefully gone over by the general. Every sentence
was weighed; and everything that might possibly convey a wrong
impression was at once rejected; evidence was called to clear up
disputed points;</p>
<p class="folio">A MODEL REPORT  <a name="page 380"><font size=
"+1">380</font></a></p>
<p class="one">no inferences or suppositions were allowed to
stand; truth was never permitted to be sacrificed to effect;
superlatives were rigorously excluded,<sup>1</sup> and the
narratives may be unquestionably accepted as an accurate relation
of the facts. Many stirring passages were added by the
general&rsquo;s own pen; and the praise bestowed upon the troops,
both officers and men, is couched in the warmest terms. Yet much
was omitted. Jackson had a rooted objection to represent the
motives of his actions, or to set forth the object of his
movements. In reply to a remonstrance that those who came after
him would be embarrassed by the absence of these explanations,
and that his fame would suffer, he said: &ldquo;The men who come
after me must act for themselves; and as to the historians who
speak of the movements of my command, I do not concern myself
greatly as to what they may say.&rdquo; To judge, then, from the
reports, Jackson himself had very little to do with his success;
indeed, were they the only evidence available, it would be
difficult to ascertain whether the more brilliant man&oelig;uvres
were ordered by himself or executed on the initiative of others.
But in this he was perfectly consistent. When the publisher of an
illustrated periodical wrote to him, asking him for his portrait
and some notes of his battles as the basis of a sketch, he
replied that he had no likeness of himself, and had done nothing
worthy of mention. It is not without interest, in this
connection, to note that the Old Testament supplied him with a
pattern for his reports, just as it supplied him, as he often
declared, with precepts and principles applicable to every
military emergency. After he was wounded, enlarging one morning
on his favourite topic of practical religion, he turned to the
staff officer in attendance, Lieutenant Smith, and asked him with
a smile: &ldquo;Can you tell me where the Bible gives generals a
model for their official reports of battles?&rdquo; The
aide-de-camp answered, laughing, that it never entered his mind
to think of looking for such a thing</p>
<p class="fnote">1  The report of Sharpsburg, which Jackson had
not yet revised at the time of his death, is not altogether free
from exaggeration.</p>
<p class="folio">A MODEL REPORT  <a name="page 381"><font size=

<p class="one">in the Scriptures. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo;
said the general, &ldquo;there are such; and excellent models,
too. Look, for instance, at the narrative of Joshua&rsquo;s
battles with the Amalekites; there you have one. It has
clearness, brevity, modesty; and it traces the victory to its
right source, the blessing of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The early spring of 1863 was undoubtedly one of the happiest
seasons of a singularly happy life. Jackson&rsquo;s ambition, if
the desire for such rank that would enable him to put the powers
within him to the best use may be so termed, was fully gratified.
The country lad who, one-and-twenty years ago, on his way to West
Point, had looked on the green hills of Virginia from the Capitol
at Washington, could hardly have anticipated a higher destiny
than that which had befallen him. Over the hearts and wills of
thirty thousand magnificent soldiers, the very flower of Southern
manhood, his empire was absolute; and such dominion is neither
the heritage of princes nor within the reach of wealth. The most
trusted lieutenant of his great commander, the strong right arm
with which he had executed his most brilliant enterprises, he
shared with him the esteem and admiration not only of the army
but of the whole people of the South. The name he had determined,
in his lonely boyhood, to bring back to honour already ranked
with those of the Revolutionary heroes. Even his enemies, for the
brave men at the front left rancour to the politicians, were not
proof against the attraction of his great achievements. A
friendly intercourse, not always confined to a trade of coffee
for tobacco, existed between the outposts; &ldquo;Johnnies&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Yanks&rdquo; often exchanged greetings across the
Rappahannock; and it is related that one day when Jackson rode
along the river, and the Confederate troops ran together, as was
their custom, to greet him with a yell, the Federal pickets,
roused by the sudden clamour, crowded to the bank, and shouted
across to ask the cause. &ldquo;General Stonewall Jackson,&rdquo;
was the proud reply of the grey-coated sentry. Immediately, to
his astonishment, the cry, &ldquo;Hurrah for Stonewall
Jackson!&rdquo; rang out from the Federal ranks, and the voices
of North</p>
<p class="folio">A MODEL REPORT  <a name="page 382"><font size=

<p class="one">and South, prophetic of a time to come, mingled in
acclamation of a great American.</p>
<p>The situation of the army, although the winter was unusually
severe, was not without its compensations. The country was
covered with snow, and storms were frequent; rations were still
scarce,<sup>1</sup> for the single line of badly laid rails,
subjected to the strain of an abnormal traffic, formed a
precarious means of transport; every spring and pond was frozen;
and the soldiers shivered beneath their scanty
coverings.<sup>2</sup> Huts, however, were in process of
erection, and the goodwill of the people did something to supply
the deficiencies of the commissariat.<sup>3</sup> The homes of
Virginia were stripped, and many&mdash;like Jackson himself,
whose blankets had already been sent from Lexington to his old
brigade&mdash;ordered their carpets to be cut up into rugs and
distributed amongst the men. But neither cold nor hunger could
crush the spirit of the troops. The bivouacs were never merrier
than on the bare hills and in the dark pine-woods which looked
down on the ruins and the graves of Fredericksburg. Picket duty
was</p>
<p class="fnote">1  On January 23 the daily ration was a quarter
of a pound of beef, and one-fifth of a pound of sugar was ordered
to be issued in addition, but there was no sugar! Lee to Davis,
O.R., vol. xxi, p. 1110. In the Valley, during the autumn, the
ration had been one and one-eighth pound of flour, and one and a
quarter pounds of beef. On March 27 the ration was eighteen
ounces of flour, and four ounces of indifferent bacon, with
occasional issues of rice, sugar, or molasses. Symptoms of scurvy
were appearing, and to supply the place of vegetables each
regiment was directed to send men daily to gather sassafras buds,
wild onions, garlic, etc., etc. Still &ldquo;the men are
cheerful,&rdquo; writes Lee, &ldquo;and I receive no
complaints.&rdquo; O.R., vol. xxv, part ii, p. 687. On April 17
the ration had been increased by ten pounds of rice to every 100
men about every third day, with a few peas and dried fruits
occasionally. O.R., vol. xxv, part ii, p. 730.<br>
2  On January 19, 1,200 pairs of shoes and 400 or 500 pairs of
blankets were forwarded for issue to men without either in D. H.
Hill&rsquo;s division, O.R., vol. xxi, p. 1097. In the Louisiana
brigade on the same date, out of 1,500 men, 400 had no covering
for their feet whatever. A large number had not a particle of
underclothing, shirts, socks, or drawers; overcoats were so rare
as to be a curiosity; the 5th Regiment could not drill for want
of shoes; the 8th was almost unfit for duty from the same cause;
the condition of the men&rsquo;s feet, from long exposure, was
horrible, and the troops were almost totally unprovided with
cooking utensils. O.R., vol. xxi, p. 1098.<br>

<p class="one">light, for the black waters of the great river
formed a secure barrier against attack; and if the men&rsquo;s
stomachs were empty, they could still feast their eyes on a
charming landscape. &ldquo;To the right and left the wooded range
extended towards Fredericksburg on the one hand, and Port Royal
on the other; in front, the far-stretching level gave full sweep
to the eye; and at the foot of its forest-clad bluffs, or by the
margin of undulating fields, the Rappahannock flowed calmly to
the sea. Old mansions dotted this beautiful land&mdash;for
beautiful it was in spite of the chill influences of winter, with
its fertile meadows, its picturesque woodlands, and its old roads
skirted by long lines of shadowy cedars.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The headquarters of the Second Army Corps were established at
Moss Neck, on the terrace above the Rappahannock, eleven miles
below Fredericksburg. After the retreat of the Federals to
Falmouth, the Confederate troops had reoccupied their former
positions, and every point of passage between Fredericksburg and
Port Royal was strongly intrenched and closely watched. At Moss
Neck Jackson was not only within easy reach of his divisions, but
was more comfortably housed than had usually been the case. A
hunting-lodge which stood on the lawn of an old and picturesque
mansion-house, the property of a gentleman named Corbin, was
placed at his disposal&mdash;he had declined the offer of rooms
in the house itself lest he should trespass on the convenience of
its inmates; and to show the peculiar constitution of the
Confederate army, an anecdote recorded by his biographers is
worth quoting. After his first interview with Mrs. Corbin, he
passed out to the gate, where a cavalry orderly who had
accompanied him was holding his horse. &ldquo;Do you approve of
your accommodation, General?&rdquo; asked the courier.
&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have decided to make my quarters here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am Mr. Corbin, sir,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;and
I am very pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lower room of the lodge, hung with trophies of the chase,
was both his bedroom and his office; while a large tent, pitched
on the grass outside, served as a messroom</p>

<p class="folio">MOSS NECK  <a name="page 384"><font size=

<p class="one">for his military family; and here for three long
months, until near the end of March, he rested from the labour of
his campaigns. The Federal troops, on the snow-clad heights
across the river, remained idle in their camps, slowly recovering
from the effects of their defeat on the fields of Fredericksburg;
the pickets had ceased to bicker; the gunboats had disappeared,
and &ldquo;all was quiet on the Rappahannock.&rdquo; Many of the
senior officers in the Confederate army took advantage of the
lull in operations to visit their homes; but, although his wife
urged him to do the same, Jackson steadfastly refused to absent
himself even for a few days from the front. In November, to his
unbounded delight, a daughter had been born to him. &ldquo;To a
man of his extreme domesticity, and love for children,&rdquo;
says his wife, &ldquo;this was a crowning happiness; and yet,
with his great modesty and shrinking from publicity, he requested
that he should not receive the announcement by telegraph, and
when it came to him by letter he kept the glad tidings to
himself&mdash;leaving his staff and those around him in the camp
to hear of it from others. This was to him &lsquo;a joy with
which a stranger could not intermeddle,&rsquo; and from which
even his own hand could not lift the veil of sanctity. His
letters were full of longing to see his little Julia; for by this
name, which had been his mother&rsquo;s, he had desired her to be
christened, saying, &lsquo;My mother was mindful of me when I was
a helpless, fatherless child, and I wish to commemorate her
now.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thankful I am,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;to our kind
Heavenly Father for having spared my precious wife and given us a
little daughter! I cannot tell how gratified I am, nor how much I
wish I could be with you and see my two darlings. But while this
pleasure is denied me, I am thankful it is accorded to you to
have the little pet, and I hope it may be a great deal of company
and comfort to its mother. Now, don&rsquo;t exert yourself to
write to me, for to know that you were exerting yourself to write
would give me more pain than the letter would pleasure, <i>so you
must not do it.</i> But you must love your <i>esposo</i> in the
mean time. . . . I expect you are just now made up with that
baby. Don&rsquo;t you wish</p>
<p class="folio">&ldquo;DUTY IS OURS&rdquo;  <a name=
"page 385"><font size="+1">385</font></a></p>
<p class="one">your husband wouldn&rsquo;t claim any part of it,
but let you have the sole ownership? Don&rsquo;t you regard it as
the most precious little creature in the world? Do not spoil it,
and don&rsquo;t let anybody tease it. Don&rsquo;t permit it to
have a bad temper. How I would love to see the darling little
thing! Give her many kisses from her father. &ldquo;At present I
am fifty miles from Richmond, and eight miles from Guiney&rsquo;s
Station, on the railroad from Richmond to Fredericksburg. Should
I remain here, I do hope you and baby can come to see me before
spring, as you can come on the railway. Wherever I go, God gives
me kind friends. The people here show me great kindness. I
receive invitation after invitation to dine out and spend the
night, and a great many provisions are sent me, including cakes,
tea, loaf-sugar, etc., and the socks and gloves and handkerchiefs
still come!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so thankful to our ever-kind Heavenly Father for
having so improved my eyes as to enable me to write at night. He
continually showers blessings upon me; and that <i>you</i> should
have been spared, and our darling little daughter given us, fills
my heart with overflowing gratitude. If I know my unworthy self,
my desire is to live entirely and unreservedly to God&rsquo;s
glory. Pray, my darling, that I may so live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again to his sister-in-law: &ldquo;I trust God will answer the
prayers offered for peace. Not much comfort is to be expected
until this cruel war terminates. I haven&rsquo;t seen my wife
since last March, and never having seen my child, you can imagine
with what interest I look to North Carolina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tender promptings of his deep natural affection were
stilled by his profound faith that &ldquo;duty is ours,
consequences are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The Confederate army, at
this time as at all others, suffered terribly from desertion; and
one of his own brigades reported 1,200 officers and men absent
without leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening,&rdquo; he wrote to his wife on Christmas
Day, &ldquo;I received a letter from Dr. Dabney, saying,
&lsquo;one of the highest gratifications both Mrs. Dabney and I
could enjoy would be another visit from Mrs. Jackson,&rsquo; and
he</p>
<p class="folio">STUART  <a name="page 386"><font size=
"+1">386</font></a></p>
<p class="one">invites me to meet you there. He and Mrs. Dabney
are very kind, but it appears to me that it is better for me to
remain with my command so long as the war continues. . . . If all
our troops, officers and men, were at their posts, we might,
through God&rsquo;s blessing, expect a more speedy termination of
the war. The temporal affairs of some are so deranged as to make
a strong plea for their returning home for a short time; but our
God has greatly blessed me and mine during my absence, and whilst
it would be a great comfort to see you and our darling little
daughter, and others in whom I take a special interest, yet duty
appears to require me to remain with my command. It is important
that those at headquarters set an example by remaining at the
post of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So business at headquarters went on in its accustomed course.
There were inspections to be made, the deficiencies of equipment
to be made good, correspondence to be conducted&mdash;and the
control of 30,000 men demanded much office-work&mdash;the enemy
to be watched, information to be sifted, topographical data to be
collected, and the reports of the battles to be written. Every
morning, as was his invariable habit during a campaign, the
general had an interview with the chiefs of the commissariat,
transport, ordnance, and medical departments, and he spent many
hours in consultation with his topographical engineer. The great
purpose for which Virginia stood in arms was ever present to his
mind, and despite his reticence, his staff knew that he was
occupied, day and night, with the problems that the future might
unfold. Existence at headquarters to the young and high-spirited
officers who formed the military family was not altogether
lively. Outside there was abundance of gaiety. The Confederate
army, even on those lonely hills, managed to extract enjoyment
from its surroundings. The hospitality of the plantations was
open to the officers, and wherever Stuart and his brigadiers
pitched their tents, dances and music were the order of the day.
Nor were the men behindhand. Even the heavy snow afforded them
entertainment. Whenever a thaw took place they set themselves to
making snow-</p>
<p class="folio">STUART  <a name="page 387"><font size=
"+1">387</font></a></p>
<p class="one">balls; and great battles, in which one division
was arrayed against another, and which were carried through with
the pomp and circumstance of war, colours flying, bugles
sounding, and long lines charging elaborately planned
intrenchments, were a constant source of amusement, except to
unpopular officers. Theatrical and musical performances enlivened
the tedium of the long evenings; and when, by the glare of the
camp-fires, the band of the 5th Virginia broke into the rattling
quick-step of &ldquo;Dixie&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo; not the least
stirring of national anthems, and the great concourse of
grey-jackets took up the chorus, closing it with a yell</p>
<p class="verse">That shivered to the tingling stars,</p>
<p class="one">the Confederate soldier would not have changed
places with the President himself.</p>
<p>There was much social intercourse, too, between the different
headquarters. General Lee was no unfrequent visitor to Moss Neck,
and on Christmas Day Jackson&rsquo;s aides-de-camp provided a
sumptuous entertainment, at which turkeys and oysters figured,
for the Commander-in-Chief and the senior generals. Stuart, too,
often invaded the quarters of his old comrade, and Jackson looked
forward to the merriment that was certain to result just as much
as the youngest of his staff. &ldquo;Stuart&rsquo;s exuberant
cheerfulness and humour,&rdquo; says Dabney, &ldquo;seemed to be
the happy relief, as they were the opposites, to Jackson&rsquo;s
serious and diffident temper. While Stuart poured out his
&lsquo;quips and cranks,&rsquo; not seldom at Jackson&rsquo;s
expense, the latter sat by, sometimes unprepared with any
repartee, sometimes blushing, but always enjoying the jest with a
quiet and merry laugh. The ornaments on the wall of the
general&rsquo;s quarters gave Stuart many a topic of badinage.
Affecting to believe that they were of General Jackson&rsquo;s
selection, he pointed now to the portrait of some famous
race-horse, and now to the print of some celebrated rat-terrier,
as queer revelations of his private tastes, indicating a great
decline in his moral character, which would be a grief and
disappointment to the pious old ladies of the South. Jackson,
with a quiet smile, replied that perhaps he had had more to do
with</p>
<p class="folio">ENGLISH VISITORS  <a name="page 388"><font size=
"+1">388</font></a></p>
<p class="one">race-horses than his friends suspected. It was in
the midst of such a scene as this that dinner was announced, and
the two generals passed to the mess-table. It so happened that
Jackson had just received, as a present from a patriotic lady,
some butter, upon the adornment of which the fair donor had
exhausted her housewife&rsquo;s skill. The servants, in honour of
General Stuart&rsquo;s presence, had chosen this to grace the
centre of the board. As his eye fell upon it, he paused, and with
mock gravity pointed to it, saying, &lsquo;There, gentlemen! If
that is not the crowning evidence of our host&rsquo;s sporting
tastes. He even has his favourite game-cock stamped on his
butter!&rsquo; The dinner, of course, began with great laughter,
in which Jackson joined, with as much enjoyment as
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visitors, too, from Europe, attracted by the fame of the army
and its leaders, had made their way into the Confederate lines,
and were received with all the hospitality that the camps
afforded. An English officer has recorded his experiences at Moss
Neck:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought from Nassau a box of goods (a present from
England) for General Stonewall Jackson, and he asked me when I
was at Richmond to come to his camp and see him. He left the city
one morning about seven o&rsquo;clock, and about ten landed at a
station distant some eight or nine miles from Jackson&rsquo;s
(or, as his men called him, Old Jack&rsquo;s) camp. A heavy fall
of snow had covered the country for some time before to the depth
of a foot, and formed a crust over the Virginian mud, which is
quite as villainous as that of Balaclava. The day before had been
mild and wet, and my journey was made in a drenching shower,
which soon cleared away the white mantle of snow. You cannot
imagine the slough of despond I had to pass through. Wet to the
skin, I stumbled through mud, I waded through creeks, I passed
through pine-woods, and at last got into camp about two
o&rsquo;clock. I then made my way to a small house occupied by
the general as his headquarters. I wrote down my name, and gave
it to the orderly, and I was immediately told to walk in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general rose and greeted me warmly. I expected</p>
<p class="folio">ENGLISH VISITORS  <a name="page 389"><font size=
"+1">389</font></a></p>
<p class="one">to see an old, untidy man, and was most agreeably
surprised and pleased with his appearance. He is tall, handsome,
and powerfully built, but thin. He has brown hair and a brown
beard. His mouth expresses great determination. The lips are thin
and compressed firmly together; his eyes are blue and dark, with
keen and searching expression. I was told that his age was
thirty-eight, and he looks forty. The general, who is
indescribably simple and unaffected in all his ways, took off my
wet overcoat with his own hands, made up the fire, brought wood
for me to put my feet on to keep them warm while my boots were
drying, and then began to ask me questions on various subjects.
At the dinner hour we went out and joined the members of his
staff. At this meal the general said grace in a fervent, quiet
manner, which struck me very much. After dinner I returned to his
room, and he again talked for a long time. The servant came in
and took his mattress out of a cupboard and laid it on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I rose to retire, the general said, &lsquo;Captain,
there is plenty of room on my bed, I hope you will share it with
me?&rsquo; I thanked him very much for his courtesy, but said
&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; and slept in a tent, sharing the
blankets of one of his aides-de-camp. In the morning at
breakfast-time I noticed that the general said grace before the
meal with the same fervour I had remarked before. An hour or two
afterwards it was time for me to return to the station; on this
occasion, however, I had a horse, and I returned to the
general&rsquo;s headquarters to bid him adieu. His little room
was vacant, so I slipped in and stood before the fire. I then
noticed my greatcoat stretched before it on a chair. Shortly
afterwards the general entered the room. He said: &lsquo;Captain,
I have been trying to dry your greatcoat, but I am afraid I have
not succeeded very well.&rsquo; That little act illustrates the
man&rsquo;s character. With the care and responsibilities of a
vast army on his shoulders he finds time to do little acts of
kindness and thoughtfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With each of his staff officers he was on most friendly</p>
<p class="folio">ENGLISH VISITORS  <a name="page 390"><font size=
"+1">390</font></a></p>
<p class="one">terms; and the visitors to his camp, such as the
English officer quoted above, found him a most delightful host,
discussing with the ease of an educated gentleman all manner of
topics, and displaying not the slightest trace of that
awkwardness and extreme diffidence which have been attributed to
him. The range and accuracy of his information surprised them.
&ldquo;Of military history,&rdquo; said another English soldier,
&ldquo;he knew more than any other man I met in America; and he
was so far from displaying the somewhat grim characteristics that
have been associated with his name, that one would have thought
his tastes lay in the direction of art and literature.&rdquo;
&ldquo;His chief delight,&rdquo; wrote the Hon. Francis Lawley,
who knew him well, &ldquo;was in the cathedrals of England,
notably in York Minster and Westminster Abbey. He was never tired
of talking about them, or listening to details about the chapels
and cloisters of Oxford.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson,&rdquo; writes Lord Wolseley,
&ldquo;had certainly very little to say about military
operations, although he was intensely proud of his soldiers, and
enthusiastic in his devotion to General Lee; and it was
impossible to make him talk of his own achievements. Nor can I
say that his speech betrayed his intellectual powers. But his
manner, which was modesty itself, was most attractive. He put you
at your ease at once, listening with marked courtesy and
attention to whatever you might say; and when the subject of
conversation was congenial, he was a most interesting companion.
I quite endorse the statement as to his love for beautiful
things. He told me that in all his travels he had seen nothing so
beautiful as the lancet windows in York Minster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his daily intercourse with his staff, however, in his
office or in the mess-room, he showed to less advantage than in
the society of strangers. His gravity of demeanour seldom wholly
disappeared, his intense earnestness was in itself oppressive,
and he was often absent and preoccupied. &ldquo;Life at
headquarters,&rdquo; says one of his staff officers, &ldquo;was
decidedly dull. Our meals were often very</p>
<p class="fnote">1  <i>The Times,</i> June 11, 1863.</p>
<p class="folio">STRATEGY  <a name="page 391"><font size=
"+1">391</font></a></p>
<p class="one">dreary. The general had no time for light or
trivial conversation, and he sometimes felt it his duty to rebuke
our thoughtless and perhaps foolish remarks. Nor was it always
quite safe to approach him. Sometimes he had a tired look in his
eyes, and although he never breathed a word to one or another, we
knew that he was dissatisfied with what was being done with the
army.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Intense concentration of thought and purpose, in itself an
indication of a powerful will, had distinguished Jackson from his
very boyhood. During his campaigns he would pace for hours
outside his tent, his hands clasped behind his back, absorbed in
meditation; and when the army was on the march, he would ride for
hours without raising his eyes or opening his lips. It was
unquestionably at such moments that he was working out his plans,
step by step, forecasting the counter-movements of the enemy, and
providing for every emergency that might occur. And here the
habit of keeping his whole faculties fixed on a single object,
and of imprinting on his memory the successive processes of
complicated problems, fostered by the methods of study which,
both at West Point and Lexington, the weakness of his eyes had
made compulsory, must have been an inestimable advantage.
Brilliant strategical man&oelig;uvres, it cannot be too often
repeated, are not a matter of inspiration and of decision on the
spur of the moment. The problems presented by a theatre of war,
with their many factors, are not to be solved except by a
vigorous and sustained intellectual effort. &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
said Napoleon, &ldquo;I always appear prepared, it is because,
before entering on an undertaking, I have meditated for long and
have foreseen what may occur. It is not genius which reveals to
me suddenly and secretly what I should do in circumstances
unexpected by others; it is thought and meditation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proper objective, speaking in general terms, of all
military operations is the main army of the enemy, for a campaign
can never be brought to a successful conclusion until the hostile
forces in the field have become demoralised</p>
<p class="fnote">1  Letter from Dr. Hunter McGuire.</p>
<p class="folio">STRATEGY  <a name="page 392"><font size=

<p class="one">by defeat; but, to ensure success, preponderance
of numbers is usually essential, and it may be said, therefore,
that the proper objective is the enemy&rsquo;s main army when it
is in inferior strength.</p>
<p>Under ordinary conditions, the first step, then, towards
victory must be a movement, or a series of movements, which will
compel the enemy to divide his forces, and put it out of his
power to assemble even equal strength on the battle-field.</p>
<p>This entails a consideration of the strategic points upon the
theatre of war, for it is by occupying or threatening some point
which the enemy cannot afford to lose that he will be induced to
disperse his army, or to place himself in a position where he can
be attacked at a disadvantage. While his main army, therefore, is
the ultimate objective, certain strategic points become the
initial objectives, to be occupied or threatened either by the
main body or detached forces. It is seldom, however, that these
initial objectives are readily discovered; and it is very often
the case that even the ultimate objective may be obscured.</p>
<p>These principles are well illustrated by the operations in the
Valley of Virginia during the month of May and the first
fortnight of June, 1862. After the event it is easy to see that
Banks&rsquo; army was Jackson&rsquo;s proper
objective&mdash;being the principal force in the secondary
theatre of war. But at the time, before the event, Lee and
Jackson alone realised the importance of overwhelming Banks and
thus threatening Washington. It was not realised by Johnston, a
most able soldier, for the whole of his correspondence goes to
show that he thought a purely defensive attitude the best policy
for the Valley Army. It was not realised by Jackson&rsquo;s
subordinates, for it was not till long after the battle of
Winchester that the real purport of the operations in which they
had been engaged began to dawn on them. It was not realised by
Lincoln, by Stanton, or even by McClellan, for to each of them
the sudden attack on Front Royal was as much of a surprise as to
Banks himself; and we may be perfectly confident that none but a
trained strategist, after</p>
<p class="folio">DEFECTS OF THE FEDERAL STRATEGY  <a name=
"page 393"><font size="+1">393</font></a></p>
<p class="one">a prolonged study of the map and the situation,
would realise it now.</p>
<p>It is to be noted, too, that Jackson&rsquo;s initial
objectives&mdash;the strategical points in the Valley&mdash;were
invariably well selected. The Luray Gap, the single road which
gives access across the Massanuttons from one side of the Valley
to the other, was the most important. The flank position on Elk
Run, the occupation of which so suddenly brought up Banks,
prevented him interposing between Jackson and Edward Johnson, and
saved Staunton from capture, was a second; Front Royal, by
seizing which he threatened Banks at Strasburg in flank and rear,
compelling him to a hasty retreat, and bringing him to battle on
ground which he had not prepared, a third; and the position at
Port Republic, controlling the only bridge across the Shenandoah,
and separating Shields from Fr&eacute;mont, a fourth. The bearing
of all these localities was overlooked by the Federals, and
throughout the campaign we cannot fail to notice a great
confusion on their part as regards objectives. They neither
recognised what the aim of their enemy would be, nor at what they
should aim themselves. It was long before they discovered that
Lee&rsquo;s army, and not Richmond, was the vital point of the
Confederacy. Not a single attempt was made to seize strategic
points, and if we may judge from the orders and dispatches in the
Official Records, their existence was never recognised. To this
oversight the successive defeats of the Northern forces were in
great part due. From McClellan to Banks, each one of their
generals appears to have been blind to the advantages that may be
derived from a study of the theatre of war. Not one of them hit
upon a line of operations which embarrassed the Confederates, and
all possessed the unhappy knack of joining battle on the most
unfavourable terms. Moreover, when it at last became clear that
the surest means of conquering a country is to defeat its armies,
the true objective was but vaguely realised. The annihilation of
the enemy&rsquo;s troops seems to have been the last thing dreamt
of. Opportunities of crushing him in detail were neither sought
for nor created. As General</p>
<p class="folio">DEFECTS OF THE FEDERAL STRATEGY  <a name=
"page 394"><font size="+1">394</font></a></p>
<p class="one">Sheridan said afterwards: &ldquo;The trouble with
the commanders of the Army of the Potomac was that they never
marched out to &lsquo;lick&rsquo; anybody; all they thought of
was to escape being &lsquo;licked&rsquo; themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not sufficient, in planning strategical
combinations, to arrive at a correct conclusion as regards the
objective. Success demands a most careful calculation of ways and
means: of the numbers at disposal; of food, forage, and
ammunition; and of the forces to he detached for secondary
purposes. The different factors of the problem&mdash;the strength
and dispositions of the enemy, the roads, railways, fortresses,
weather, natural features, the <i>moral</i> of the opposing
armies, the character of the opposing general, the facilities for
supply have each and all of them to be considered, their relative
prominence assigned to them, and their conflicting claims to be
brought into adjustment.</p>
<p>For such mental exertion Jackson was well equipped. He had
made his own the experience of others. His knowledge of history
made him familiar with the principles which had guided Washington
and Napoleon in the selection of objectives, and with the means
by which they attained them. It is not always easy to determine
the benefit, beyond a theoretical acquaintance with the phenomena
of the battle-field, to be derived from studying the campaigns of
the great masters of war. It is true that no successful general,
whatever may have been his practical knowledge, has neglected
such study; but while many have borne witness to its efficacy,
none have left a record of the manner in which their knowledge of
former campaigns influenced their own conduct.</p>
<p>In the case of Stonewall Jackson, however, we have much
evidence, indirect, but unimpeachable, as to the value to a
commander of the knowledge thus acquired. The Maxims of Napoleon,
carried in his haversack, were constantly consulted throughout
his campaigns, and this little volume contains a fairly complete
exposition, in Napoleon&rsquo;s own words, of the grand
principles of war. Moreover, Jackson often quoted principles
which are not to be found in the Maxims, but on which
Napoleon</p>
<p class="folio">MILITARY HISTORY  <a name="page 395"><font size=
"+1">395</font></a></p>
<p class="one">consistently acted. It is clear, therefore, that
he had studied the campaigns of the great Corsican in order to
discover the principles on which military success is based; that
having studied and reflected on those principles, and the effect
their application produced, in numerous concrete cases, they
became so firmly imbedded in his mind as to be ever present,
guiding him into the right path, or warning him against the
wrong, whenever he had to deal with a strategic or tactical
situation.</p>
<p>It may be noted, moreover, that these principles, especially
those which he was accustomed to quote, were concerned far more
with the moral aspect of war than with the material. It is a fair
inference, therefore, that it was to the study of human nature as
affected by the conditions of war, by discipline, by fear, by the
want of food, by want of information, by want of confidence, by
the weight of responsibility, by political interests, and, above
all, by surprise, that his attention was principally directed. He
found in the campaigns of Jena and of Austerlitz not merely a
record of marches and man&oelig;uvres, of the use of
intrenchments, or of the general rules for attack and defence;
this is the mechanical and elementary part of the science of
command. What Jackson learned was the truth of the famous maxim
that the moral is to the physical&mdash;that is, to armament and
numbers&mdash;as three to one. He learned, too, to put himself
into his adversary&rsquo;s place and to realise his weakness. He
learned, in a word, that war is a struggle between two intellects
rather than the conflict of masses; and it was by reason of this
knowledge that he played on the hearts of his enemies with such
extraordinary skill.</p>
<p>It is not to be asserted, however, that the study of military
history is an infallible means of becoming a great or even a good
general. The first qualification necessary for a leader of men is
a strong character, the second, a strong intellect. With both
Providence had endowed Jackson, and the strong intellect
illuminates and explains the page that to others is obscure and
meaningless. With its innate faculty for discerning what is
essential and for discarding unimportant details, it discovers
most valuable lessons</p>
<p class="folio">MILITARY HISTORY  <a name="page 396"><font size=

<p class="one">where ordinary men see neither light nor leading.
Endowed with the power of analysis and assimilation, and
accustomed to observe and to reflect upon the relations between
cause and effect, it will undoubtedly penetrate far deeper into
the actual significance and practical bearing of historical facts
than the mental vision which is less acute.</p>
<p>Jackson, by reason of his antecedent training, was eminently
capable of the sustained intellectual efforts which strategical
conceptions involve. Such was his self-command that under the
most adverse conditions, the fatigues and anxieties of a
campaign, the fierce excitement of battle, his brain, to use the
words of a great Confederate general, &ldquo;worked with the
precision of the most perfect machinery.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> But
it was not only in the field, when the necessity for action was
pressing, that he was accustomed to seclude himself with his own
thoughts. Nor was he content with considering his immediate
responsibilities. His interest in the general conduct of the war
was of a very thorough-going character. While in camp on the
Rappahannock, he followed with the closest attention the
movements of the armies operating in the Valley of the
Mississippi, and made himself acquainted, so far as was possible,
not only with the local conditions of the war, but also with the
character of the Federal leaders. It was said that, in the late
spring of 1862, it was the intention of Mr. Davis to transfer him
to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, and it is possible
that some inkling of this determination induced him to study the
Western theatre.<sup>2</sup> Be this as it may, the general
situation, military and political, was always in his mind, and
despite the victory of Fredericksburg, the future was dark and
the indications ominous.</p>
<p>According to the Official Records, the North, at the beginning
of April, had more than 900,000 soldiers under</p>
<p class="fnote">1  General G. B. Gordon. <i>Introduction to
Memoirs of Stonewall Jackson,</i> p. 14.<br>
2  In April he wrote to his wife: &ldquo;There is increasing
probability that I may be elsewhere as the season
advances.&rdquo; That he said no more is characteristic.</p>
<p class="folio">THE SITUATION  <a name="page 397"><font size=
"+1">397</font></a></p>
<p class="one">arms; the South, so far as can be ascertained, not
more than 600,000. The Army of the Potomac was receiving constant
reinforcements, and at the beginning of April, 130,000 men were
encamped on the Stafford Heights. In the West, the whole extent
of the Mississippi, with the exception of the hundred miles
between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, was held by the Federals, and
those important fortresses were both threatened by large armies,
acting in concert with a formidable fleet of gunboats. A third
army, over 50,000 strong, was posted at Murfreesboro&rsquo;, in
the heart of Tennessee, and large detached forces were operating
in Louisiana and Arkansas. The inroads of the enemy in the West,
greatly aided by the waterways, were in fact far more serious
than in the East; but even in Virginia, although the Army of the
Potomac had spent nearly two years in advancing fifty miles, the
Federals had a strong foothold. Winchester had been reoccupied.
Fortress Monroe was still garrisoned. Suffolk, on the south bank
of the James, seventy miles from Richmond, was held by a force of
20,000 men; while another small army, of about the same strength,
occupied New Berne, on the North Carolina coast.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, before the pressure of vastly superior
numbers, the frontiers of the Confederacy were contracting; and
although in no single direction had a Federal army moved more
than a few miles from the river which supplied it, yet the
hostile occupation of these rivers, so essential to internal
traffic, was making the question of subsistence more difficult
every day. Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, the cattle-raising
States, were practically cut off from the remainder; and in a
country where railways were few, distances long, and roads
indifferent, it was impossible, in default of communication by
water, to accumulate and distribute the produce of the farms.
Moreover, the dark menace of the blockade had assumed more
formidable proportions. The Federal navy, gradually increasing in
numbers and activity, held the highway of the ocean in an iron
grip; and proudly though the Confederacy bore her isolation, men
looked across the waters with dread foreboding, for the shadow of
their doom was already rising from the pitiless sea.</p>
<p class="folio">THE SITUATION  <a name="page 398"><font size=
"+1">398</font></a></p>
<p>If, then, his staff officers had some reason to complain of
their chief&rsquo;s silence and abstraction, it was by no means
unfortunate for the South, so imminent was the danger, that the
strong brain was incessantly occupied in forecasting the
emergencies that might occur.</p>
<p>But not for a single moment did Jackson despair of ultimate
success. His faith in the justice of the Southern cause was as
profound as his trust in God&rsquo;s good providence. He had long
since realised that the overwhelming strength of the Federals was
more apparent than real. He recognised their difficulties; he
knew that the size of an army is limited to the number that can
be subsisted, and he relied much on the superior <i>moral</i> and
the superior leading of the Confederate troops. After long and
mature deliberation he had come to a conclusion as to the policy
to be pursued. &ldquo;We must make this campaign,&rdquo; he said,
in a moment of unusual expansion, &ldquo;an exceedingly active
one. Only thus can a weaker country cope with a stronger; it must
make up in activity what it lacks in strength. A defensive
campaign can only be made successful by taking the aggressive at
the proper time. Napoleon never waited for his adversary to
become fully prepared, but struck him the first blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On these principles Jackson had good reason to believe General
Lee had determined to act;<sup>1</sup> of their efficacy he was
convinced, and when his wife came to visit him at the end of
April, she found him in good heart and the highest spirits. He
not only anticipated a decisive result from the forthcoming
operations, but he had seen with peculiar satisfaction that a
more manly tone was pervading the Confederate army. Taught by
their leaders, by Lee, Jackson, Stuart, and many others, of whose
worth and valour they had received convincing proof, the Southern
soldiers had begun to practise the clean and wholesome virtue of
self-control. They had discovered that purity</p>

long line than by moving into the enemy&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;

680.</p>

<p class="one">and temperance are by no means incompatible with
military prowess, and that a practical piety, faithful in small
things as in great, detracts in no degree from skill and
resolution in the field. The Stonewall Brigade set the example.
As soon as their own huts were finished, the men, of their own
volition, built a log church, where both officers and men,
without distinction of rank, were accustomed to assemble during
the winter evenings; and those rude walls, illuminated by pine
torches cut from the neighbouring forest, witnessed such scenes
as filled Jackson&rsquo;s cup of content to overflowing. A
chaplain writes: &ldquo;The devout listener, dressed in simple
grey, ornamented only with three stars, which any Confederate
colonel was entitled to wear, is our great commander, Robert
Edward Lee. That dashing-looking cavalry-man, with
&lsquo;fighting jacket,&rsquo; plumed hat, jingling spurs, and
gay decorations, but solemn, devout aspect during the service, is
&lsquo;Jeb&rsquo; Stuart, the flower of cavaliers&mdash;and all
through the vast crowd wreaths and stars of rank mingle with the
bars of the subordinate officers and the rough garb of the
private soldier. But perhaps the most supremely happy of the
gathered thousands is Stonewall Jackson.&rdquo; &ldquo;One could
not,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;sit in that pulpit and meet the
concentrated gaze of those men without deep emotion. I remembered
that they were the veterans of many a bloody field. The eyes
which looked into mine, waiting for the Gospel of peace, had
looked steadfastly upon whatever is terrible in war. Their
earnestness of aspect constantly impressed me. . . . They looked
as if they had come on business, and very important business, and
the preacher could scarcely do otherwise than feel that he, too,
had business of moment there!</p>
<p>At this time, largely owing to Jackson&rsquo;s exertions,
chaplains were appointed to regiments and brigades, and ministers
from all parts of the country were invited to visit the camps.
The Chaplains&rsquo; Association, which did a good work in the
army, was established at his suggestion, and although he
steadfastly declined to attend its meetings,</p>
<p class="folio">THE CHAPLAINS&rsquo; ASSOCIATION  <a name=
"page 400"><font size="+1">400</font></a></p>
<p class="one">deeming them outside his functions, nothing was
neglected, so far as lay within his power, that might forward the
moral welfare of the troops.</p>
<p>But at the same time their military efficiency and material
comforts received his constant attention. Discipline was made
stricter, indolent and careless officers were summarily
dismissed, and the divisions were drilled at every favourable
opportunity. Headquarters had been transferred to a tent near to
Hamilton&rsquo;s Crossing, the general remarking, &ldquo;It is
rather a relief to get where there will be less comfort than in a
room, as I hope thereby persons will be prevented from
encroaching so much upon my time.&rdquo; On his wife&rsquo;s
arrival he moved to Mr. Yerby&rsquo;s plantation, near
Hamilton&rsquo;s Crossing, but &ldquo;he did not permit,&rdquo;
she writes, &ldquo;the presence of his family to interfere in any
way with his military duties. The greater part of each day he
spent at his headquarters, but returned as early as he could get
off from his labours, and devoted all his leisure time to ha
visitors&mdash;little Julia having his chief attention and his
care. His devotion to his child was remarked upon by all who
beheld the happy pair together, for she soon learned to delight
in his caresses as much as he loved to play with her. An
officer&rsquo;s wife, who saw him often during this time, wrote
to a friend in Richmond that &lsquo;the general spent all his
leisure time in playing with the baby.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="date">April 29  </span> But these quiet and happy
days were soon ended. On April 29 the roar of cannon was heard
once more at Gurney&rsquo;s Station, salvo after salvo following
in quick succession, until the house shook and the windows
rattled with the reverberations. The crash of musketry succeeded,
rapid and continuous, and before the sun was high wounded men
were brought in to the shelter of Mr. Yerby&rsquo;s outhouses.
Very early in the morning a message from the pickets had come in,
and after making arrangements for his wife and child to leave at
once for Richmond, the general, without waiting for breakfast,
had hastened to the front. The Federals were crossing the</p>

thereby.</p>
<p class="note">III.  On the march the troops are to have a rest
of ten minutes each hour. The rate of march is not to exceed one
mile in twenty-five minutes, unless otherwise specially ordered.
The time of each division commander will be taken from that of
the corps commander. When the troops are halted for the purpose
of resting, arms will be stacked, ranks broken, and in no case
during the march will the troops be allowed to break ranks
without previously stacking arms.</p>
<p class="note">IV.  When any part of a battery or train is
disabled on a march, the officer in charge must have it removed
immediately from the road, so that no part of the command be
impeded upon its march.</p>
<p class="note">Batteries or trains must not stop in the line of
march to water; when any part of a battery or train, from any
cause, loses its place in the column, it must not pass any part
of the column in regaining its place.</p>
<p class="note">Company commanders will march at the rear of
their respective companies; officers must be habitually occupied
in seeing that orders are strictly enforced; a day&rsquo;s march
should be with them a day of labour; as much vigilance is
required on the march as in camp.</p>
<p class="note">Each division commander will, as soon as he
arrive at his camping-ground, have the company rolls called, and
guard details marched to the front of the regiment before
breaking ranks; and immediately afterwards establish his chain of
sentinels, and post his pickets so as to secure the safety of his
command, and will soon thereafter report to their headquarters
the disposition made for the security of his camp.</p>

respecting their divisions are carried out strictly; each
division commander before leaving an encampment will have all
damages occasioned by his command settled for by payment or
covered by proper certificates.</p>
